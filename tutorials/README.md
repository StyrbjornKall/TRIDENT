# `tutorials`
Contains tutorials for using the fine-tuned models presented in the publication for inference. Note, the same models are also available through [ecoCAIT](https://ecocait.streamlit.app/) where a user interface can be used to make predictions and explore other interesting things. 

These tutorials are ment for processing very large datasets, or for model exploration. Otherwise, refer to the website instead.
