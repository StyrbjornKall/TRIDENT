FISH 96-h LC50 (Mortality)

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The fish 96-h LC50 values used to develop this SAR were measured and the octanol
water partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program,
KOWWIN (Version 1.67). The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log 96-h LC50 (mmol/L) = -0.4869 (log Kow) - 0.2329

The LC50 is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 3+1; and the Coefficient of Determination
(R2) = 0.7993. To convert the LC50 from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight
of the compound.

Maximum Kow: 5.0
Maximum MW: 1000

GREEN ALGAE ChV

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The green algae chronic values (ChV) used to develop this SAR were measured, and
the octanol water partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer
program, KOWWIN (Version 1.67). The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log ChV (mmol/L) = -0.5524 (log Kow) + 0.0389

The ChV is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 1 + 1; and the Coefficient of Determination
(R2) = N/A. To convert the ChV from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of
the compound.

The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log ChV (mmol/L) = -0.7267 (log Kow) + 0.1234

The ChV is in millimoles per liter (mM/L). To convert the ChV from mM/L to mg/L,
multiply by the molecular weight of the compound.

DAPHNID 48-h LC50

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The daphnid 48-h LC50 values used to develop this SAR were measured, and the octanol water
partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program, KOWWIN (Version
1.67). The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log 48-h EC50 (mmol/L) = -0.5348 (log Kow) - 0.0767

The EC50 is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 3 + 1; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) =
0.9553. To convert the LC50 from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the
compound.

GREEN ALGAE ChV

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The green algae chronic values (ChV) used to develop this SAR were measured and the octanol
water partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program, KOWWIN
(Version 1.67). The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log ChV (mmol/L) = -0.2047 (log Kow) – 3.0227

The ChV is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 1 + 1; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) =
N/A. To convert the ChV from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the compound.

No adequate data were available for the acrylamides salt water fish chronic value (ChV) SAR.
Predictions for this endpoint were estimated using the acute-to-chronic ratio, and were based on
the acute saltwater fish SAR for acid halides. The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log ChV (mmol/L) = -0.4411 log Kow – 1.2009

The ChV is in millimoles per liter (mM/L). To convert the ChV from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the
molecular weight of the compound.

FISH 96-h LC50 (Mortality)

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The fish 96-h LC50 values used to develop this SAR were measured and the octanol water
partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program, KOWWIN (Version
1.67). The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log 96-h LC50 (mmol/L) = -0.2414 (log Kow) - 1.358
                                                                                                                             2
The LC50 is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 16 + 2; and the Coefficient of Determination (R ) =
0.9047. To convert the LC50 from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the
compound.

APPLICATION:
This SAR may be used to estimate the toxicity of acrylates with log Kow values of less than 5.0
and molecular weights less than 1000. Allyl acrylates are expected to be about 30 times more
toxic than predicted by this SAR.

OTHER APPLICATIONS:
This SAR may be used for polyacrylates with log Kow values less than 5.0 and molecular weights
less than 1000.

LIMITATIONS:
If the log Kow value is greater than 5.0, or if the compound is solid and the LC50 exceeds the
water solubility by 10X, no effects at saturation are predicted.

DAPHNID 48-h LC50

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The daphnid 48-h LC50 values used to develop this SAR were measured, and the octanol water
partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program, KOWWIN (Version
1.67). The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log 48-h LC50 (mmol/L) = -0.335 (log Kow) - 0.7635
                                                                                                                            2
The LC50 is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 7 + 2; and the Coefficient of Determination (R ) =
0.6996. To convert the EC50 from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the
compound.

GREEN ALGAE 96-h EC50

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The green algae 96-h EC50 values used to develop this SAR were measured, and the octanol
water partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program, KOWWIN
(Version 1.67). The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log 96-h EC50 (mmol/L) = -0.1638 (log Kow) - 1.78
                                                                                                                       2
The EC50 is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 6 + 1; and the Coefficient of Determination (R ) =
0.2077. To convert the EC50 from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the
compound.

FISH (SW) 96-h LC50 (Mortality)

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The saltwater fish 96-h LC50 values used to develop this SAR were measured and the octanol
water partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program, KOWWIN
(Version 1.67). The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log 96-h LC50 (mmol/L) = -0.1819 (log Kow) - 1.7603
                                                                                                                            2
The LC50 is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 1 + 1; and the Coefficient of Determination (R ) =
N/A. To convert the LC50 from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the compound.

FISH 96-h LC50 (Mortality)

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The fish 96-h LC50 values used to develop this SAR were measured and the octanol water
partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program, KOWWIN (Version
1.67). The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log 96-h LC50 (mmol/L) = -0.5236 (log Kow) - 0.1958

The LC50 is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 59 + 5; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) =
0.5513. To convert the LC50 from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the
compound.

Maximum Kow: 5.0
Maximum MW: 1000

APPLICATION:
This SAR may be used to estimate the toxicity of aldehydes (mono) with log Kow values of less
than 5.0 and molecular weights less than 1000. Acrolein is about 1400 times more toxic than
predicted by this SAR.

LIMITATIONS:
If the log Kow value is greater than 5.0, or if the compound is solid and the LC50 exceeds the
water solubility by 10X, no effects at saturation are predicted.

DAPHNID 48-h EC50

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The daphnid 48-h LC50 values used to develop this SAR were measured, and the octanol water
partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program, KOWWIN (Version
1.67). The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log 48-h LC50 (mmol/L) = -0.7401 (log Kow) + 0.4451

The LC50 is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 8 + 2; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) =
0.9362. To convert the LC50 from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the
compound.

GREEN ALGAE 96-h EC50

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The green algae 96-h EC50 values used to develop this SAR were measured, and the octanol
water partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program, KOWWIN
(Version 1.67). Based on observed effects for green algae, this chemical class is not expressing
excess toxicity compared to neutral organics. The class-specific SAR equation is yielding similar
toxicity values than estimated from baseline toxicity (neutral organics), which may be related to
testing artifacts. These chemicals may be acting in a manner similar to neutral organics.
Therefore, either the empirically based class-specific GA96 equation or the neutral organics
GA96 equation would be appropriate to estimate toxicity. The class-specific SAR equation is:

Log 96-h EC50 (mmol/L) = -0.6418 (log Kow) + 0.432

The EC50 is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 1 + 2; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) =
0.9816. To convert the EC50 from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the
compound.

FISH ChV

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The fish chronic values (ChV) used to develop this SAR were measured, and the octanol water
partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program, KOWWIN (Version
1.67). The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log ChV (mmol/L) = -0.6945 (log Kow) - 0.6738

The ChV is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 2 + 1; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) =
0.966. To convert the ChV from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the
compound.

GREEN ALGAE ChV

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The green algae chronic values (ChV) used to develop this SAR were measured, and the octanol
water partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program, KOWWIN
(Version 1.67). Based on observed effects for green algae, this chemical class is not expressing
excess toxicity compared to neutral organics. The class-specific SAR equation is yielding similar
toxicity values than estimated from baseline toxicity (neutral organics), which may be related to
testing artifacts. These chemicals may be acting in a manner similar to neutral organics.
Therefore, either the empirically based class-specific GAChV equation or the neutral organics
GAChV equation would be appropriate to estimate toxicity. The class-specific SAR equation is:

Log ChV (mmol/L) = -0.5465 (log Kow) - 0.2005

The ChV is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 5 + 1; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) =
0.991. To convert the ChV from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the
compound.

DAPHNID ChV

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The daphnid chronic values (ChV) used to develop this SAR were measured, and the octanol
water partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program, KOWWIN
(Version 1.67). The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log ChV (mmol/L) = -0.5253 (log Kow) - 1.6174

The ChV is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 1 + 1; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) =
N/A. To convert the ChV from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the compound.

Log 96-h LC50 (mmol/L) = -0.657 (log Kow) + 0.5975

The LC50 is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 90 + 32; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2)

APPLICATION:
This SAR may be used to estimate toxicity for aliphatic amines.

LIMITATIONS:
If the log Kow value is greater than 5.0, or if the compound is solid and the LC50 exceeds the
water solubility by 10X, no effects at saturation are predicted.

Aliphatic polyamines with greater than 3 aliphatic amines and/or an amine-nitrogen composition
of ≥ 25% exhibit excess toxicity based on available CBI data. Insufficient data were available to
construct a QSAR, but fish toxicity test data of compounds with 27% amine-nitrogen resulted in
LC50 values that were ~100x more toxic than estimations predicted from the aliphatic amine class.

DAPHNID 48-h LC50

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The daphnid 48-h LC50 values used to develop this SAR were measured, and the octanol water
partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program, KOWWIN (Version
1.67). The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log 48-h LC50 (mmol/L) = -0.6065 (log Kow) - 0.4272

The LC50 is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 24 + 20; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2)
= 0.7634. To convert the LC50 from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the
compound.

Maximum Kow: 5.0
Maximum MW: 1000

APPLICATION:
This SAR may be used to estimate toxicity for aliphatic amines.

LIMITATIONS:
If the log Kow value is greater than 5.0, or if the compound is solid and the LC50 exceeds the
water solubility by 10X, no effects at saturation are predicted.

Aliphatic polyamines with greater than 3 aliphatic amines and/or an amine-nitrogen composition
of ≥ 25% exhibit excess toxicity based on available CBI data. Insufficient data were available to
construct a QSAR, but daphnid toxicity test data of compounds with 25% to 27% amine-nitrogen
resulted in LC50 values that were ~450x and ~6,500x more toxic, respectively, than estimations
predicted from the aliphatic amine class.

GREEN ALGAE 96-h EC50

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The green algae 96-h EC50 values used to develop this SAR were measured, and the octanol
water partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program, KOWWIN
(Version 1.67). The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log 96-h EC50 (mmol/L) = -0.7064 (log Kow) – 0.3109

The EC50 is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 35 + 11; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2)
= 0.7788. To convert the EC50 from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the
compound.

Maximum Kow: 6.4
Maximum MW: 1000

APPLICATION:
This SAR may be used to estimate toxicity for aliphatic amines.

LIMITATIONS:
If the log Kow value is greater than 6.4, or if the compound is solid and the EC50 exceeds the
water solubility by 10X, no effects at saturation are predicted.

Aliphatic polyamines with greater than 3 aliphatic amines and/or an amine-nitrogen composition
of ≥ 25% exhibit excess toxicity based on available CBI data. Insufficient data were available to
construct a QSAR, but algae toxicity test data of compounds with 25% or 27% amine-nitrogen
resulted in EC50 values that were >10,000x more toxic than estimations for the aliphatic amine
class.

FISH ChV

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The fish chronic values (ChV) used to develop this SAR were measured and the octanol water
partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program, KOWWIN (Version
1.67). The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log ChV (mmol/L) = -0.8109 (log Kow) – 0.3296

The ChV is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 3 + 1; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) =
0.977. To convert the ChV from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the
compound.

Maximum Kow: 8.0
Maximum MW: 1000

APPLICATION:
This SAR may be used to estimate toxicity for aliphatic amines.

LIMITATIONS:
If the log Kow value is greater than 8.0, or if the compound is solid and the ChV exceeds the
water solubility by 10X, no effects at saturation are predicted.

Aliphatic polyamines with greater than 3 aliphatic amines and/or an amine-nitrogen composition
of ≥ 25% exhibit excess toxicity based on available CBI data. Insufficient data were available to
construct a QSAR.

DAPHNID ChV

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The daphnid chronic values (ChV) used to develop this SAR were measured and the octanol
water partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program, KOWWIN
(Version 1.67). The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log ChV (mmol/L) = -0.5574 (log Kow) – 1.6108

The ChV is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 5 + 2; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) =
0.8023. To convert the ChV from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the
compound.

Maximum Kow: 8.0
Maximum MW: 1000

APPLICATION:
This SAR may be used to estimate toxicity for aliphatic amines.

LIMITATIONS:
If the log Kow value is greater than 8.0, or if the compound is solid and the ChV exceeds the
water solubility by 10X, no effects at saturation are predicted.

Aliphatic polyamines with greater than 3 aliphatic amines and/or an amine-nitrogen composition
of ≥ 25% exhibit excess toxicity based on available CBI data. Insufficient data were available to
construct a QSAR.

FISH ChV

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
No adequate data were available for the alkoxy silanes fish chronic value (ChV) SAR.
Predictions for this endpoint were estimated using the acute-to-chronic ratio, and were based on
the acute fish SAR for alkoxy silanes. The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log ChV (mmol/L) = -0.552 (log Kow) – 1.7837

The ChV is in millimoles per liter (mM/L). To convert the ChV from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the
molecular weight of the compound.

DAPHNID 48-h LC50

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The daphnid 48-h LC50 values used to develop this SAR were measured, and the octanol water
partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program, KOWWIN (Version
1.67). The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log 48-h LC50 (mmol/L) = -0.9152 (log Kow) + 1.3475

The LC50 is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 12 + 12; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2)
= 0.7924. To convert the LC50 from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the
compound.

Maximum Kow: 5.0
Maximum MW: 1000

APPLICATION:
This SAR may be used to estimate toxicity for amides.

LIMITATIONS:
If the log Kow value is greater than 5.0, or if the compound is solid and the LC50 exceeds the
water solubility by 10X, no effects at saturation are predicted.

GREEN ALGAE 96-h EC50

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The green algae 96-h EC50 values used to develop this SAR were measured, and the octanol
water partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program, KOWWIN
(Version 1.67). The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log 96-h EC50 (mmol/L) = -0.6214 (log Kow) – 0.7843

The EC50 is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 8 + 4; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) =
0.2009. To convert the EC50 from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the
compound.

APPLICATION:
This SAR may be used to estimate toxicity for amides.

LIMITATIONS:
If the log Kow value is greater than 6.4, or if the compound is solid and the EC50 exceeds the
water solubility by 10X, no effects at saturation are predicted.

Certain acetanilides exhibit excess toxicity in algae; however, insufficient information was
available to determine which moiety (e.g., halogen) was driving this excess toxicity.

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The fish chronic value (ChV) used to develop this SAR was measured, and the octanol water
partition coefficient (Kow) was calculated using the computer program, KOWWIN (Version 1.67).
The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log 96-h EC50 (mmol/L) = -0.4569 (log Kow) – 2.3768

The ChV is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 9 + 1; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) =
0.3433. To convert the ChV from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the
compound.

DAPHNID ChV

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The daphnid chronic value (ChV) used to develop this SAR was measured, and the octanol water
partition coefficient (Kow) was calculated using the computer program, KOWWIN (Version 1.67).
Based on observed effects for daphnids, this chemical class is not expressing excess toxicity
compared to neutral organics. The class-specific SAR equation is yielding similar toxicity values
to those estimated from baseline toxicity (neutral organics), which may be related to testing
artifacts. Therefore, either the empirically based class-specific DChV equation or the neutral
organics DChV equation would be appropriate to estimate toxicity. The class-specific SAR
equation is:

Log ChV (mmol/L) = -0.6285 (log Kow) – 0.477

The ChV is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 8 + 3; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) =

GREEN ALGAE ChV

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The green algae chronic values (ChV) used to develop this SAR were measured, and the octanol
water partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program, KOWWIN
(Version 1.67). The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log ChV (mmol/L) = -0.4382 (log Kow) – 1.1779

The ChV is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 3 + 1; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) =
0.9754. To convert the ChV from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the
compound.

MYSID SHRIMP 96-h LC50

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The saltwater mysid shrimp 96-h LC50 values used to develop this SAR were measured, and the
octanol water partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program, KOWWIN
(Version 1.67). The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log 96-h LC50 (mmol/L) = - 0.5737 (log Kow) - 0.6302

The LC50 is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 5 + 1; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) =
0.5887. To convert the LC50 from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the
compound.

FISH ChV

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
No adequate data were available for the anilines (amino-para) fish chronic value SAR
endpoint. Predictions for this endpoint were estimated using the acute-to-chronic ratio,
and were based on the acute fish SAR for anilines (amino-para). The SAR equation
used to estimate toxicity is:

Log ChV (mmol/L) = -0.2318 (log Kow) - 4.3457

The ChV is in millimoles per liter (mM/L). To convert the ChV from mM/L to mg/L,
multiply by the molecular weight of the compound.

Maximum Kow: 8.0
Maximum MW: 1000

FISH 96-h LC50 (Mortality)

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The fish 96-h LC50 values used to develop this SAR were measured and the octanol water
partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program, KOWWIN (Version
1.67). The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log 96-h LC50 (mmol/L) = -0.7985 (log Kow) + 1.0225

The LC50 is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 2 + 1; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) =
0.9975. To convert the LC50 from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the
compound.

DAPHNID 48-h LC50

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The daphnid 48-h LC50 values used to develop this SAR were measured, and the octanol water
partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program, KOWWIN (Version
1.67). The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log 48-h LC50 (mmol/L) = -0.4502 (log Kow) - 1.4785

The LC50 is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 2 + 1; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) =
0.9996. To convert the LC50 from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the
compound.

FISH 96-h LC50 (Mortality)

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The fish 96-h LC50 values used to develop this SAR were measured and the octanol
water partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program,
KOWWIN (Version 1.67). The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log 96-h LC50 (mmol/L) = -0.6126 (log Kow) - 0.292

The LC50 is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 1 + 1; and the Coefficient of
Determination (R2) = N/A. To convert the LC50 from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the
molecular weight of the compound.

GREEN ALGAE ChV

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
No adequate data were available for the anilines (amino-ortho) green algae chronic
value (ChV) SAR endpoint. Predictions for this endpoint were estimated using the
acute-to-chronic ratio, and were based on the acute green algae SAR for anilines
(amino-ortho). The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log ChV (mmol/L) = y = -0.1567 (log Kow) - 3.4063

The ChV is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 0 + 2; and the Coefficient of Determination
(R2) = N/A. To convert the ChV from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of
the compound.

DAPHNID 48-h LC50

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The daphnid 48-h LC50 values used to develop this SAR were measured, and the octanol water partition
coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program, KOWWIN (Version 1.67). The SAR equation
used to estimate toxicity is:

Log 48-h LC50 (mmol/L) = -0.6987 (log Kow) + 0.4722

The LC50 is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 6 + 2; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) = 0.9629. To
convert the LC50 from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the compound.

The green algae 96-h EC50 values used to develop this SAR were measured, and the octanol water partition

The EC50 is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 2 + 2; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) = 0.9359. To

Log ChV (mmol/L) = -0.6546 (log Kow) + 0.6542

The ChV is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 2 + 2; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) = 0.9872. To
convert the ChV from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the compound.

FISH 96-h LC50 (Mortality)

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The fish 96-h LC50 values used to develop this SAR were measured and the octanol water
partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program, KOWWIN (Version
1.67). The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log 96-h LC50 (mmol/L) = -0.6965 (log Kow) + 0.5471

The LC50 is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 49 + 3; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2)
= 0.7129. To convert the LC50 from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the
compound.

APPLICATION:
This SAR may be used to estimate toxicity for unhindered anilines.

LIMITATIONS:
Di- and tri-nitroanilines are more toxic than predicted; a fish 96-h LC50 SAR has been
developed for dinitroanilines.

2,3,5,6-Tetrachloroaniline is 19 times more toxic than predicted by this SAR. Tetrabromoaniline
may be more toxic than predicted by this SAR as well.
N-substituted anilines are less toxic than predicted by this SAR; for these compounds use the
neutral organics fish 96-h LC50 SAR.

FISH 14-day LC50 (Mortality)

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The fish 14-day LC50 values used to develop this SAR were measured, and the octanol
water partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program,
KOWWIN (Version 1.67). The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log 14-d LC50 (mmol/L) = -1.0287 log Kow + 0.9914

The LC50 is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 15; and the Coefficient of Determination
(R2) = 0.8215. To convert the LC50 from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight
of the compound.

DAPHNID 48-h LC50

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The daphnid 48-h LC50 values used to develop this SAR were measured, and the
octanol water partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program,
KOWWIN (Version 1.67). The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log 48-h LC50 (mmol/L) = -0.0096 (log Kow) – 2.1266

The LC50 is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 22 + 2; and the Coefficient of
Determination (R2) = 0.0004. To convert the LC50 from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the
molecular weight of the compound.

APPLICATION:
This SAR may be used to estimate toxicity for unhindered anilines.

LIMITATIONS:
Di- and tri-nitroanilines are more toxic than predicted by this SAR; a daphnid 48-h LC50
SAR has been developed for dinitroanilines.
Tetrachloro- and tetrabromo-aniline may be 20 times more toxic than predicted by this
SAR.

N-substituted anilines are less toxic than predicted by this SAR; for these compounds
use the daphnid 48-h LC50 SAR for neutral organics.

GREEN ALGAE 96-h EC50

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The green algae 96-h EC50 values used to develop this SAR were measured, and the
octanol water partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program,
KOWWIN (Version 1.67). The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log 96-h EC50 (mmol/L) = -0.238 (log Kow) - 1.4679

The EC50 is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 4 + 1; and the Coefficient of
Determination (R2) = 0.6754. To convert the EC50 from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the
molecular weight of the compound.

APPLICATION:
This SAR may be used to estimate toxicity for unhindered anilines.

LIMITATIONS:
Di- and tri-nitroanilines are more toxic than predicted by this SAR.

Tetrachloro- and tetrabromo-aniline may be 20 times more toxic than predicted by this
SAR.
N-substituted anilines are less toxic than predicted by this SAR; for these compounds
use the algae 96-h EC50 SAR for neutral organics.

DAPHNID ChV

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The daphnid ChV values used to develop this SAR were measured, and the octanol
water partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program,
KOWWIN (Version 1.67). The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log ChV (mmol/L) = -0.295 (log Kow) - 3.3272

The ChV is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 4; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2)
= 0.3884. To convert the ChV from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of
the compound.

GREEN ALGAE 96-h EC50

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
No adequate data were available for the aziridines acute green algae SAR endpoint.
Predictions for this endpoint were estimated using the chronic-to-acute ratio, and were
based on the chronic green algae SAR for aziridines. The SAR equation used to
estimate toxicity is:

Log 96-h EC50 (mmol/L) = -0.3747 (log Kow) - 1.5719

The EC50 is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 0 + 2; and the Coefficient of
Determination (R2) = N/A. To convert the EC50 from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the
molecular weight of the compound.

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The green algae chronic values (ChV) used to develop this SAR were measured and the
octanol water partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program,
KOWWIN (Version 1.67). The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log ChV (mmol/L) = -0.313 (log Kow) - 2.156

The ChV is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 1 + 1; and the Coefficient of Determination
(R2) = N/A. To convert the ChV from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of
the compound.

FISH 96-h LC50 (Mortality)

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The fish 96-h LC50 values used to develop this SAR were measured and the octanol water partition
coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program, KOWWIN (Version 1.67). Based on
observed effects for fish, this chemical class is not expressing excess toxicity compared to neutral
organics. The class-specific SAR equation is yielding lower toxicity values than estimated from baseline
toxicity (neutral organics), which may be related to testing artifacts. These chemicals may be acting in a
manner similar to neutral organics. Therefore, either the empirically based class-specific F96 equation or
the neutral organics F96 equation would be appropriate to estimate toxicity. The class-specific SAR
equation is:

Log 96-h LC50 (mmol/L) = -0.9586 (log Kow) + 2.1738

The LC50 is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 5 + 1; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) = 0.8577.
To convert the LC50 from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the compound.

MYSID SHRIMP (SW) 96-h LC50 (Mortality)

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The saltwater mysid shrimp 96-h LC50 values used to develop this SAR were measured and the octanol
water partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program, KOWWIN (Version 1.67).
Based on observed effects for mysid shrimp, this chemical class is not expressing excess toxicity
compared to neutral organics. The class-specific SAR equation is yielding similar toxicity values than
estimated from baseline toxicity (neutral organics), which may be related to testing artifacts. These
chemicals may be acting in a manner similar to neutral organics. Therefore, either the empirically based
class-specific M96(SW) equation or the neutral organics M96(SW) equation would be appropriate to
estimate toxicity. The class-specific SAR equation is:

Log 96-h LC50 (mmol/L) = -1.2018 (log Kow) + 2.3291

The LC50 is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 1 + 1; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) = N/A. To
convert the LC50 from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the compound.

GREEN ALGAE 96-h EC50

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The green algae 96-h EC50 values used to develop this SAR were measured and the octanol
water partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program, KOWWIN
(Version 1.67). The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log 96-h EC50 (mmol/L) = -0.4274 (log Kow) - 0.8061

The EC50 is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 5 + 2; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) =
0.7977. To convert the EC50 from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the
compound.

APPLICATION:
This SAR may be used to estimate the toxicity of substituted benzotriazoles with substitutions on
the 5th position. Toxicity estimates for substituted benzotriazoles with substitutions on the triazole
ring may not be valid with this SAR.

This SAR may be used for substituted benzotriazoles with substitutions on the 3rd, 4th or 6th

LIMITATIONS:
If the log Kow value is greater than 6.4, or if the compound is solid and the EC50 exceeds the
water solubility by 10X, no effects at saturation are predicted.

APPLICATION:
This SAR may be used to estimate the toxicity of substituted benzotriazoles with substitutions on
the 5th position. Toxicity estimates for substituted benzotriazoles with substitutions on the triazole
ring may not be valid with this SAR.

This SAR may be used for substituted benzotriazoles with substitutions on the 3rd, 4th or 6th
position (other benzo positions).

LIMITATIONS:
If the log Kow value is greater than 8.0, or if the compound is solid and the ChV exceeds the
water solubility by 10X, no effects at saturation are predicted.

FISH 96-h LC50 (Mortality)

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
No adequate data were available for the benzoylcyclohexanedione acute fish SAR endpoint. Predictions
for this endpoint were estimated using the acute-to-chronic ratio, and were based on the chronic fish SAR
for benzoylcyclohexanedione. The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log 96-h LC50 (mmol/L) = -0.6846 (log Kow) + 0.643

The LC50 is in millimoles per liter (mM/L). To convert the LC50 from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the
molecular weight of the compound.

DAPHNID 48-h LC50 (Mortality)

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The daphnid 48-h LC50 values used to develop this SAR were measured and the octanol water partition
coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program, KOWWIN (Version 1.67). Based on
observed effects for daphnids, this chemical class is not expressing excess toxicity compared to neutral
organics. The class-specific SAR equation is yielding lower toxicity values than estimated from baseline
toxicity (neutral organics), which may be related to testing artifacts. These chemicals may be acting in a
manner similar to neutral organics. Therefore, either the empirically based class-specific D48 equation or
the neutral organics D48 equation would be appropriate to estimate toxicity. The class-specific SAR
equation is:

Log 48-h LC50 (mmol/L) = -0.9458 (log Kow) + 1.8381

The LC50 is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 2 + 1; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) = 0.9995.
To convert the LC50 from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the compound.

DAPHNID ChV

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The daphnid chronic values (ChV) used to develop this SAR were measured and the octanol
water partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program, KOWWIN
(Version 1.67). Based on observed effects for daphnids, this chemical class is not expressing
excess toxicity compared to neutral organics. The class-specific SAR equation is yielding lower
toxicity values than estimated from baseline toxicity (neutral organics), which may be related to
testing artifacts. These chemicals may be acting in a manner similar to neutral organics.
Therefore, either the empirically based class-specific DChV equation or the neutral organics
DChV equation would be appropriate to estimate toxicity. The class-specific SAR equation is:

Log ChV (mmol/L) = -0.8541 (log Kow) + 0.9686

The ChV is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 2 + 1; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) =
0.9964. To convert the ChV from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the
compound.

FISH 96-h LC50 (Mortality)

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The fish 96-h LC50 values used to develop this SAR were measured and the octanol
water partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program,
KOWWIN (Version 1.67). The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log 96-h LC50 (mmol/L) = -0.8812 (log Kow) + 1.2439

The LC50 is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 11 + 4; and the Coefficient of
Determination (R2) = 0.9312. To convert the LC50 from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the
molecular weight of the compound.

Maximum Kow: 5.0
Maximum MW: 1000

FISH ChV

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The fish chronic values (ChV) used to develop this SAR were measured and the octanol
water partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program,
KOWWIN (Version 1.67). The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log ChV (mmol/L) = -0.7879 (log Kow) + 0.0048

The ChV is in millimoles per liter (mM/L). To convert the ChV from mM/L to mg/L,
multiply by the molecular weight of the compound.

The ChV is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 5 + 1; and the Coefficient of Determination
(R2) = 0.9473. To convert the ChV from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight
of the compound.

DAPHNID ChV

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
No adequate data were available for the benzyl alcohols daphnid chronic value (ChV)
SAR. Predictions for this endpoint were estimated using the acute-to-chronic ratio, and
were based on the acute daphnid SAR for benzyl alcohols. Based on observed effects for
daphnids, this chemical class is not expressing excess toxicity compared to neutral organics.
The class-specific SAR equation is yielding similar toxicity values than estimated from baseline
toxicity (neutral organics), which may be related to testing artifacts. These chemicals may be
acting in a manner similar to neutral organics. Therefore, either the empirically based class-
specific daphnid ChV equation or the neutral organics daphnid ChV equation would be
appropriate to estimate toxicity. The class-specific SAR equation is:

Log ChV (mmol/L) = -0.7371 (log Kow) + 0.0769

The ChV is in millimoles per liter (mM/L). To convert the ChV from mM/L to mg/L,
multiply by the molecular weight of the compound.

The green algae chronic values (ChV) used to develop this SAR were measured and the

APPLICATION:
This SAR may be used to estimate the toxicity for benzyl halides with log Kow value <6.0
and molecular weights <1000.

Benzyl halides with a carboxylic acid substitution will be about 10 times less toxic than
the toxicity value predicted using this SAR with a log Kow and MW for the free acid.
Therefore, for benzyl halides with a carboxylic acid substitution, predict the toxicity value
for the free acid and multiply by 10.
Benzyl fluorides may be less toxic than predicted.

LIMITATIONS:
For benzyl halides which are liquids at room temperature and with log Kow values
greater than 6.0, a test duration of greater than 96 hours will be required for proper
expression of toxicity. Also, if the toxicity value obtained by the use of this equation
exceeds the water solubility of the compound (measured or estimated), mortalities
greater than 50% would not be expected in a saturated solution during an exposure
period of 96 hours.

FISH 14-day LC50 (Mortality)

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The fish 14-day LC50 values used to develop this SAR were measured and the octanol
water partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program,
KOWWIN (Version 1.67). The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log 14-d LC50 (mmol/L) = -0.1894 (log Kow) - 2.3699

The LC50 is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 4 + 1; and the Coefficient of
Determination (R2) = 0.3963. To convert the LC50 from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the
molecular weight of the compound.

                            n=4+1



APPLICATION:
This SAR may be used to estimate the toxicity for benzyl halides with log Kow values <
6.0 and molecular weights <1000.

Benzyl halides with a carboxylic acid substitution will be about 10 times less toxic than
the toxicity value predicted using this SAR with a log Kow and MW for the free acid.
Therefore, for benzyl halides with a carboxylic acid substitution, predict the toxicity value
for the free acid and multiply by 10.
Benzyl fluorides may be less toxic than predicted.

LIMITATIONS:
For benzyl halides which are liquids at room temperature and with log Kow values
greater than 6.0, a test duration of greater than 14 days will be required for proper
expression of toxicity. Also, if the toxicity value obtained by the use of this equation
exceeds the water solubility of the compound (measured or estimated), mortalities
greater than 50% would not be expected in a saturated solution during an exposure
period of 96 hours.

FISH ChV

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The fish chronic values (ChV) used to develop this SAR were measured and the
octanol water partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer
program, KOWWIN (Version 1.67). The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity
is:
Log ChV (mmol/L) = -0.69 (log Kow) – 0.68

The ChV is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 1 + 1; and the Coefficient of
Determination (R2) = N/A. To convert the ChV from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the
molecular weight of the compound.

APPLICATION:
This SAR may be used to estimate toxicity for benzyl halides with log Kow values <8.0
and molecular weights <1000.

Benzyl halides with a carboxylic acid substitution will be about 10 times less toxic than
the toxicity value predicted using this SAR with a log Kow and MW for the free acid.
Therefore, for benzyl halides with a carboxylic acid substitution, predict the toxicity value
for the free acid and multiply by 10.

Benzyl fluorides may be less toxic than predicted.

LIMITATIONS:
If the log Kow value is greater than 8, or if the compound is solid and the ChV exceeds
the water solubility by 10X, no effects at saturation are predicted.

APPLICATION:
This SAR may be used to estimate the toxicity for benzyl halides with log Kow value <6.0
and molecular weights <1000.

Benzyl halides with a carboxylic acid substitution will be about 10 times less toxic than
the toxicity value predicted using this SAR with a log Kow and MW for the free acid.
Therefore, for benzyl halides with a carboxylic acid substitution, predict the toxicity value
for the free acid and multiply by 10.
Benzyl fluorides may be less toxic than predicted.

LIMITATIONS:
For benzyl halides which are liquids at room temperature and with log Kow values
greater than 6.0, a test duration of greater than 96 hours will be required for proper
expression of toxicity. Also, if the toxicity value obtained by the use of this equation
exceeds the water solubility of the compound (measured or estimated), mortalities
greater than 50% would not be expected in a saturated solution during an exposure
period of 96 hours.

Log 96-h LC50 (mmol/L) = -0.4263 (log Kow) – 1.261

The LC50 is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 2 + 1; and the Coefficient of
Determination (R2) = 0.3194. To convert the LC50 from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the
molecular weight of the compound.

                   n=2+1


APPLICATION:
This SAR may be used to estimate the toxicity for benzyl halides with log Kow values <
5.0 and molecular weights <1000.
Benzyl halides with a carboxylic acid substitution will be about 10 times less toxic than
the toxicity value predicted using this SAR with a log Kow and MW for the free acid.
Therefore, for benzyl halides with a carboxylic acid substitution, predict the toxicity value
for the free acid and multiply by 10.

Benzyl fluorides may be less toxic than predicted.

LIMITATIONS:
If the log Kow value is greater than 5, or if the compound is solid and the LC50 exceeds
the water solubility by 10X, no effects at saturation are predicted.

DAPHNIA 48-h LC50

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The daphnia 48-h LC50 values used to develop this SAR were measured and the octanol water
partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program, KOWWIN (Version
1.67). Based on observed effects for daphnids, this chemical class is not expressing excess
toxicity compared to neutral organics. The class-specific SAR equation is yielding lower toxicity
values than estimated from baseline toxicity (neutral organics), which may be related to testing
artifacts or may indicate that these chemicals are acting in a manner similar to neutral organics.
Therefore, either the empirically based class-specific D48 equation or the neutral organics D48
equation would be appropriate to estimate toxicity. The class-specific SAR equation is:

Log 48-h LC50 (mmol/L) = -0.9922 (log Kow) + 2.035

The LC50 is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 2 + 1; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) =
0.9985. To convert the LC50 from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the
compound.

DAPHNID ChV

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The daphnid chronic values (ChV) used to develop this SAR were measured and the octanol
water partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program, KOWWIN
(Version 1.67). The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log Daphnia ChV (mmol/L) = -0.6121 (log Kow) – 0.9236

The ChV is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 1 + 1; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) =
N/A. To convert the LC50 from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the compound.

FISH 96-h LC50 (Mortality)

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The fish 96-h LC50 values used to develop this SAR were measured and the octanol water
partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program, KOWWIN (Version
1.67). The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log 96-h LC50 (mmol/L) = -0.4048 (log Kow) – 1.6878

The LC50 is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 18; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) =
0.4475. To convert the LC50 from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the
compound.

Maximum Kow: 5
Maximum MW: 1000

APPLICATION:
This SAR may be used to estimate the toxicity of O-oxime substituted carbamate esters. Static
tests without analytical confirmation of test substance concentrations were excluded due to
potential instability of carbamate esters.

LIMITATIONS:
If the low Kow value is greater than 5.0, or if the compound is solid and the LC50 exceeds the
water solubility by 10X, no effects at saturation are predicted.

FISH ChV

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The fish chronic values (ChV) used to develop this SAR were measured and the octanol water
partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program, KOWWIN (Version
1.67). The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log ChV (mmol/L) = -0.3876 (log Kow) – 2.8179

The ChV is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 5; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) =
0.8025. To convert the ChV from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the
compound.

FISH 96-h LC50 (Mortality)

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The fish 96-h LC50 values used to develop this SAR were measured and the octanol water
partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program, KOWWIN (Version
1.67). The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log 96-h LC50 (mmol/L) = -0.3478 (log Kow) - 0.9147

The LC50 is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 23 + 1; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) =
0.1697. To convert the LC50 from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the
compound.

Maximum Kow: 5
Maximum MW: 1000

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The daphnid 48-h LC50 values used to develop this SAR were measured and the octanol water
partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program, KOWWIN (Version
1.67). The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log 48-h LC50 (mmol/L) = -0.8588 (log Kow) – 2.4

The LC50 is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 5. To convert the LC50 from mM/L to mg/L,
multiply by the molecular weight of the compound.

GREEN ALGAE 96-h EC50

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The green algae 96-h EC50 values used to develop this SAR were measured and the octanol
water partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program, KOWWIN
(Version 1.67). The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log 96-h EC50 (mmol/L) = -0.5105 (log Kow) – 0.7573

The EC50 is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 5 + 1; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) =
0.9196. To convert the EC50 from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the
compound.

FISH 96-h LC50 (Mortality)

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The fish 96-h LC50 values used to develop this SAR were measured and the octanol water
partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program, KOWWIN (Version
1.67). The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log 96-h LC50 (mmol/L) = -0.7294 (log Kow) + 0.6028

The LC50 is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 8 + 1; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) =
0.7975. To convert the LC50 from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the
compound.

APPLICATION:
This SAR may be used to estimate the toxicity of carbamate esters. Static tests without analytical
confirmation of test substance concentrations were excluded due to potential instability of
carbamate esters.

LIMITATIONS:
If the low Kow value is greater than 5.0, or if the compound is solid and the LC50 exceeds the

FISH ChV

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
No adequate data were available for the carbamate esters fish chronic value (ChV) SAR.
Predictions for this endpoint were estimated using the acute-to-chronic ratio, and were based on
the acute fish SAR for carbamate esters. The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log ChV (mmol/L) = -0.727 (log Kow) – 0.3843

The ChV is in millimoles per liter (mM/L). To convert the ChV from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the
molecular weight of the compound.

Maximum Kow: 8
Maximum MW: 1000

DAPHNID 48-h LC50

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The daphnid 48-h LC50 values used to develop this SAR were measured and the
octanol water partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer
program, KOWWIN (Version 1.67). The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity
is:

Log 48-h LC50 (mmol/L) = -1.0007 (log Kow) + 0.5342

The LC50 is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 9 + 1; and the Coefficient of
Determination (R2) = 0.6954. To convert the LC50 from mM/L to mg/L, multiply
by the molecular weight of the compound.

DAPHNID ChV

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The daphnid chronic values (ChV) used to develop this SAR were measured and
the octanol water partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer
program, KOWWIN (Version 1.67). The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity
is:

Log ChV (mmol/L) = -0.6516 (log Kow) – 1.3304

The ChV is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 4 + 1; and the Coefficient of
Determination (R2) = 0.6507. To convert the ChV from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by
the molecular weight of the compound.

Mysid (SW) 96-h LC50

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The mysid (SW) 96-h LC50 values used to develop this SAR were measured and
the octanol water partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer
program, KOWWIN (Version 1.67). The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity
is:

Log 96-h LC50 (mmol/L) = -1.3464 (log Kow) + 1.3032

The LC50 is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 3 + 2; and the Coefficient of
Determination (R2) = 0.6885. To convert the LC50 from mM/L to mg/L, multiply
by the molecular weight of the compound.

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The fish (SW) chronic values (ChV) used to develop this SAR were measured and
the octanol water partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer
program, KOWWIN (Version 1.67). The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
No adequate data were available for the aromatic diazoniums fish chronic value (ChV)
SAR. Predictions for this endpoint were estimated using the acute-to-chronic ratio, and
were based on the acute fish SAR for aromatic diazoniums. The SAR equation used to
estimate toxicity is:

Log ChV (mmol/L) = -0.392 (log Kow) - 3.0637

The ChV is in millimoles per liter (mM/L). To convert the ChV from mM/L to mg/L,
multiply by the molecular weight of the compound.

FISH 96-h LC50 (Mortality)

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The fish 96-h LC50 values used to develop this SAR were measured and the octanol
water partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program,
KOWWIN (Version 1.67). The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log 96-h LC50 (mmol/L) = -0.595 (log Kow) - 0.0081

The LC50 is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 21 + 1; and the Coefficient of
Determination (R2) = 0.6836. To convert the LC50 from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the
molecular weight of the compound.

Maximum Kow: 5
Maximum MW: 1000

APPLICATION:
This SAR may be used to estimate toxicity for aliphatic diketones with log Kow values
less than 5.0 and molecular weights less than 1000.

LIMITATIONS:
If the log Kow value is greater than 5.0, or if the compound is solid and the LC50
exceeds the water solubility by 10X, no effects at saturation are predicted.

GREEN ALGAE 96-h EC50

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
No adequate data were available for the diketones green algae 96-hour acute toxicity
SAR. Predictions for this endpoint were estimated using the chronic-to-acute ratio, and
were based on the chronic green algae SAR for diketones. The SAR equation used to
estimate toxicity is:

Log 96-h EC50 (mmol/L) = -0.473 (log Kow) - 0.9429

The EC50 is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 1+1. To convert the EC50 from mM/L to
mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the compound.

FISH ChV

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
No adequate data were available for the diketones fish chronic value (ChV) SAR.
Predictions for this endpoint were estimated using the acute-to-chronic ratio and were
based on the acute fish SAR for diketones. The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity
is:

Log ChV (mmol/L) = -0.649 (log Kow) – 1.0081

The ChV is in millimoles per liter (mM/L). To convert the ChV from mM/L to mg/L,
multiply by the molecular weight of the compound.

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The fish 96-h LC50 values used to develop this SAR were measured and the octanol
water partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program,
KOWWIN (Version 1.67). The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log 96-h LC50 (mmol/L) = -0.5459 (log Kow) + 0.0922

The LC50 is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 7 + 2; and the Coefficient of
Determination (R2) = 0.9457. To convert the LC50 from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the
molecular weight of the compound.

Monoepoxides are significantly more toxic than predicted by this SAR and should be
assessed with the haloepoxides SAR.

Endrin has an excess toxicity of over 33,000 times the value predicted by this SAR.
Diepoxides are significantly more toxic than predicted by this SAR and a SAR for
diepoxides has been developed.

FISH 14-day LC50

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The fish 14-day LC50 values used to develop this SAR were measured and the octanol
water partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program,
KOWWIN (Version 1.67). The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log 14-d LC50 (mmol/L) = -0.463 (log Kow) - 0.1736

The LC50 is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 8 + 2; and the Coefficient of
Determination (R2) = 0.8824. To convert the LC50 from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the
molecular weight of the compound.

APPLICATION:
This equation may be used to estimate toxicity for monoepoxides with log Kow values
less than 6.0 and molecular weights less than 1000.

LIMITATIONS:
If the log Kow value is greater than 6.0, or if the compound is solid and the LC50
exceeds the water solubility by 10X, no effects at saturation are predicted.

Monoepoxides are significantly more toxic than predicted by this SAR and should be
assessed with the haloepoxides SAR.

Diepoxides are significantly more toxic than predicted by this SAR and a SAR for
diepoxides has been developed.

GREEN ALGAE 96-h EC50

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The green algae 96-h EC50 values used to develop this SAR were measured and the
octanol water partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program,
KOWWIN (Version 1.67). Based on observed effects for green algae, this chemical
class is not expressing excess toxicity compared to neutral organics. The class-specific
SAR equation is yielding similar toxicity values than estimated from baseline toxicity
(neutral organics), which may be related to testing artifacts. These chemicals may be
acting in a manner similar to neutral organics. Therefore, either the empirically based
class-specific GA96 equation or the neutral organics GA96 equation would be
appropriate to estimate toxicity. The class-specific SAR equation is:

Log 96-h EC50 (mmol/L) = -0.7978 (log Kow) + 1.0201

The EC50 is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 3 + 1; and the Coefficient of
Determination (R2) = 0.9784. To convert the EC50 from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the
molecular weight of the compound.

FISH ChV

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The fish chronic values (ChV) used to develop this SAR were measured and the octanol
water partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program,
KOWWIN (Version 1.67). The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log ChV (mmol/L) = -0.3412 (log Kow) - 3.4706

The ChV is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 2 + 1; and the Coefficient of Determination
(R2) = 0.847. To convert the ChV from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight
of the compound.

GREEN ALGAE ChV

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The green algae chronic values (ChV) used to develop this SAR were measured and the
octanol water partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program,
KOWWIN (Version 1.67). Based on observed effects for green algae, this chemical
class is not expressing excess toxicity compared to neutral organics. The class-specific
SAR equation is yielding lower toxicity values than estimated from baseline toxicity
(neutral organics), which may be related to testing artifacts. These chemicals may be
acting in a manner similar to neutral organics. Therefore, either the empirically based
class-specific algal GAChV equation or the neutral organics GAChV equation would be
appropriate to estimate toxicity. The class-specific SAR equation is:

Log ChV (mmol/L) = -0.6516 (log Kow) + 0.5531

The ChV is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 1 + 1; and the Coefficient of Determination
(R2) = N/A. To convert the ChV from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of
the compound.

FISH 14-day LC50 (Mortality)

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The fish 14-day LC50 values used to develop this SAR were measured and the octanol
water partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program,
KOWWIN (Version 1.67). The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log 14-d LC50 (mmol/L) = -0.3454 (log Kow) - 1.3547

The LC50 is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 2 + 1; and the Coefficient of
Determination (R2) = 0.8696. To convert the LC50 from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the
molecular weight of the compound.

DAPHNID 48-h LC50

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The daphnid 48-h LC50 values used to develop this SAR were measured and the
octanol water partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program,
KOWWIN (Version 1.67). The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log 48-h LC50 (mmol/L) = -0.2937 (log Kow) - 1.4417

The LC50 is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 1 + 2; and the Coefficient of
Determination (R2) = N/A. To convert the LC50 from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the
molecular weight of the compound.

MYSID SHRIMP (SW) 96-h LC50 (Mortality)

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:

The saltwater mysid shrimp 96-h LC50 values used to develop this SAR were measured
and the octanol water partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer
program, KOWWIN (Version 1.67). The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log 96-h LC50 (mmol/L) = -0.3282 (log Kow) - 2.0391

The LC50 is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 1 + 1; and the Coefficient of
Determination (R2) = N/A. To convert the LC50 from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the
molecular weight of the compound.

DAPHNID 48-h LC50

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The daphnid 48-h LC50 values used to develop this SAR were measured and the
octanol water partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program,
KOWWIN (Version 1.67). The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log 48-h LC50 (mmol/L) = -0.2142 (log Kow) – 4.5771

The LC50 is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 9 + 1; and the Coefficient of
Determination (R2) = 0.1557. To convert the LC50 from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the
molecular weight of the compound.

FISH ChV

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The fish chronic values (ChV) used to develop this SAR were measured and the octanol
water partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program,
KOWWIN (Version 1.67). The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log ChV (mmol/L) = -0.2004 (log Kow) – 3.5203

The ChV is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 15 + 1; and the Coefficient of
Determination (R2) = 0.0677. To convert the ChV from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the
molecular weight of the compound.

Application:
This SAR may be used to estimate toxicity for dithiophosphate esters.

Limitations:
If the log Kow value is greater than 8.0, or if the compound is solid and the ChV exceeds
the water solubility by 10X, no effects at saturation are predicted.

Application:
This SAR may be used to estimate toxicity for monothiophosphate esters.

Limitations:
If the log Kow value is greater than 5.0, or if the compound is solid and the LC50 exceeds the
water solubility by 10X, no effects at saturation are predicted.

DAPHNID 48-h LC50

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The daphnid 48-h LC50 values used to develop this SAR were measured and the octanol water
partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program, KOWWIN (Version
1.67). The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log 48-h LC50 (mmol/L) = -0.5065 (log Kow) – 3.4374

The LC50 is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 17 + 1; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) =
0.1709. To convert the LC50 from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the
compound.

Maximum Kow: 5.0
Maximum MW: 1000

GREEN ALGAE 96-h EC50

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The green algae 96-h EC50 values used to develop this SAR were measured and the octanol
water partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program, KOWWIN
(Version 1.67). The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log 96-h EC50 (mmol/L) = -0.629 (log Kow) + 0.0844

The EC50 is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 2 + 1; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) =
0.9964. To convert the EC50 from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the
compound.

FISH ChV

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The fish chronic values (ChV) used to develop this SAR were measured and the octanol water
partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program, KOWWIN (Version
1.67). The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log ChV (mmol/L) = -0.7973 (log Kow) – 0.7755

The ChV is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 13; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) =
0.3411. To convert the ChV from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the
compound.

DAPHNID ChV

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The daphnid chronic values (ChV) used to develop this SAR were measured and the octanol
water partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program, KOWWIN
(Version 1.67). The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log ChV (mmol/L) = - 0.2227 (log Kow) – 5.7203

The ChV is in millimoles per liter (mM/L). N = 8; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) = 0.046.
To convert the ChV from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the compound.

Maximum Kow: 8.0

Application:
This SAR may be used to estimate toxicity for monothiophosphate esters.

Limitations:
If the log Kow value is greater than 8.0, or if the compound is solid and the ChV exceeds the
water solubility by 10X, no effects at saturation are predicted.

GREEN ALGAE ChV

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
No adequate data were available for the monothiophosphate green algae chronic value (ChV)
SAR. Predictions for this endpoint were estimated using the acute-to-chronic ratio, and were
based on the acute green algae SAR for monothiophosphate esters. The SAR equation used to
estimate toxicity is:

Log ChV (mmol/L) = -0.5258 (log Kow) – 0.4538

The ChV is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 1 + 1; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) =
N/A. To convert the ChV from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the compound.

MYSID SHRIMP (SW) 96-h LC50 (Mortality)

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The saltwater mysid shrimp 96-h LC50 values used to develop this SAR were measured and the
octanol water partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program, KOWWIN
(Version 1.67). The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log 96-h LC50 (mmol/L) = -0.1262 (log Kow) – 5.1708

The LC50 is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 14 + 1; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) =
0.0086. To convert the LC50 from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the
compound.

                             n = 27


Application:
This SAR may be used to estimate toxicity for phosphate esters; however, some halogenated
tri-alkylphosphate esters may be significantly more toxic (e.g., 1,2-dibromoethyldiethyl
phosphate ester - 400 X, 1,2-dichloroethyldiethyl phosphate ester - approx. 30 X). Since efforts
to identify and reclassify weak and strong acetylcholinesterase and cholinesterase inhibitors are
ongoing, the present SAR may over- or under-estimate toxicity.

Limitations:
If the log Kow value is greater than 5.0, or if the compound is solid and the LC50 exceeds the
water solubility by 10X, no effects at saturation are predicted.

DAPHNID 48-h LC50

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The daphnid 48-h LC50 values used to develop this SAR were measured and the octanol water
partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program, KOWWIN (Version
1.67). The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log 96-h LC50 (mmol/L) = -0.381 (log Kow) – 3.635

The LC50 is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 7; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) =
0.2174. To convert the LC50 from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the
compound.

Maximum Kow: 5.0
Maximum MW: 1000

Application:
This SAR may be used to estimate toxicity for phosphate esters; however, some halogenated
tri-alkylphosphate esters may be significantly more toxic (e.g., 1,2-dibromoethyldiethyl
phosphate ester - 400 X, 1,2-dichloroethyldiethyl phosphate ester - approx. 30 X). Since efforts
to identify and reclassify weak and strong acetylcholinesterase and cholinesterase inhibitors are
ongoing, the present SAR may over- or under-estimate toxicity.

Limitations:
If the log Kow value is greater than 5.0, or if the compound is solid and the LC50 exceeds the
water solubility by 10X, no effects at saturation are predicted.

GREEN ALGAE 96-h EC50

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The green algae 96-h EC50 values used to develop this SAR were measured and the octanol
water partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program, KOWWIN
(Version 1.67). Based on observed effects for green algae, this chemical class is not expressing excess
toxicity compared to neutral organics. The class-specific SAR equation is yielding lower toxicity values
than estimated from baseline toxicity (neutral organics), which may be related to testing artifacts. These
chemicals may be acting in a manner similar to neutral organics. Therefore, either the empirically based
class-specific GA96 equation or the neutral organics GA96 equation would be appropriate to estimate
toxicity. The class-specific SAR equation is:

Log 96-h EC50 (mmol/L) = -1.1951 (log Kow) + 3.6788

The EC50 is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 1 + 1; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) =
N/A. To convert the EC50 from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the
compound.

Application:
This SAR may be used to estimate toxicity for phosphate esters; however, some halogenated
tri-alkylphosphate esters may be significantly more toxic (e.g., 1,2-dibromoethyldiethyl
phosphate ester - 400 X, 1,2-dichloroethyldiethyl phosphate ester - approx. 30 X). Since efforts
to identify and reclassify weak and strong acetylcholinesterase and cholinesterase inhibitors are
ongoing, the present SAR may over- or under-estimate toxicity.

Limitations:
If the log Kow value is greater than 6.4, or if the compound is solid and the EC50 exceeds the
water solubility by 10X, no effects at saturation are predicted.

DAPHNID ChV

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The daphnid chronic values (ChV) used to develop this SAR were measured and the octanol
water partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program, KOWWIN
(Version 1.67). The class-specific SAR equation is yielding toxicity values with little correlation,
which may be related to testing artifacts or variations in modes of action (MOAs). Therefore,
alternative predictive methods such as chemical analog analysis may be more appropriate to
estimate this endpoint.

GREEN ALGAE ChV

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The green algae chronic values (ChV) used to develop this SAR were measured and the
octanol water partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program,
KOWWIN (Version 1.67). Based on observed effects for green algae, this chemical class is not
expressing excess toxicity compared to neutral organics. The class-specific SAR equation is
yielding lower toxicity values than estimated from baseline toxicity (neutral organics), which may
be related to testing artifacts. These chemicals may be acting in a manner similar to neutral
organics. Therefore, either the empirically based class-specific GAChV equation or the neutral
organics GA96 equation would be appropriate to estimate toxicity. The class-specific SAR
equation is:

Log ChV (mmol/L) = -0.6077 (log Kow) + 0.8709

The ChV is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 3 + 1; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) =
0.5053. To convert the ChV from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the
compound.

Application:
This SAR may be used to estimate toxicity for phosphate esters; however, some halogenated
tri-alkylphosphate esters may be significantly more toxic (e.g., 1,2-dibromoethyldiethyl
phosphate ester - 400 X, 1,2-dichloroethyldiethyl phosphate ester - approx. 30 X). Since efforts
to identify and reclassify weak and strong acetylcholinesterase and cholinesterase inhibitors are
ongoing, the present SAR may over- or under-estimate toxicity.

Limitations:
If the log Kow value is greater than 8.0, or if the compound is solid and the ChV exceeds the
water solubility by 10X, no effects at saturation are predicted.

FISH (SW) ChV

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The saltwater fish ChV values used to develop this SAR were measured and the octanol water
partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program, KOWWIN (Version
1.67). The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log ChV (mmol/L) = - 0.2882 (log Kow) – 2.8395

The ChV is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); and N = 2 + 1; and the Coefficient of Determination
(R2) = 0.5094. To convert the ChV from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the
compound.

Maximum Kow: 8.0
Maximum MW: 1000

Application:
This SAR may be used to estimate toxicity for phosphate esters; however, some halogenated
tri-alkylphosphate esters may be significantly more toxic (e.g., 1,2-dibromoethyldiethyl
phosphate ester - 400 X, 1,2-dichloroethyldiethyl phosphate ester - approx. 30 X). Since efforts
to identify and reclassify weak and strong acetylcholinesterase and cholinesterase inhibitors are
ongoing, the present SAR may over- or under-estimate toxicity.
Limitations:
If the log Kow value is greater than 8.0, or if the compound is solid and the ChV exceeds the
water solubility by 10X, no effects at saturation are predicted.

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The saltwater mysid ChV values used to develop this SAR were measured and the octanol
water partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program, KOWWIN
(Version 1.67). The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

DAPHNID 48-h LC50

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:

The daphnid 48-h LC50 values used to develop this SAR were measured and the
octanol water partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program,
KOWWIN (Version 1.67). The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log 96-h LC50 (mmol/L) = -0.6305 (log Kow) + 0.7049

The LC50 is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 40 + 21; and the Coefficient of
Determination (R2) = 0.7984. To convert the LC50 from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the
molecular weight of the ester.

Maximum Kow: 5.0
Maximum MW: 1000

APPLICATIONS:
This SAR may be used to estimate toxicity for the following esters.
1. Acetates
2. Benzoates
3. Dicarboxylic aliphatics
4. Phthalates, derived from aliphatic alcohols and phenols.
LIMITATIONS:
If the log Kow value is greater than 5.0, or if the compound is solid and the LC50
exceeds the water solubility by 10X, no effects at saturation are predicted.

GREEN ALGAE 96-h EC50 (Growth)

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:

The green algae 96-h EC50 values used to develop this SAR were measured and the
octanol water partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program,
KOWWIN (Version 1.67). The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log 96-h EC50 (mmol/L) = -0.6993 (log Kow) + 0.4715

The EC50 is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 20 + 6; and the Coefficient of
Determination (R2) = 0.8581. To convert the EC50 from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the
molecular weight of the ester.

Maximum Kow: 6.4
Maximum MW: 1000

APPLICATIONS:
This SAR may be used to estimate toxicity for the following esters.
5. Acetates
6. Benzoates
7. Dicarboxylic aliphatics
8. Phthalates, derived from aliphatic alcohols and phenols.

LIMITATIONS:
If the log Kow value is greater than 6.4, or if the compound is solid and the EC50
exceeds the water solubility by 10X, no effects at saturation are predicted.

FISH ChV

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The fish chronic values (ChV) used to develop this SAR were measured and the octanol
water partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program,
KOWWIN (Version 1.67). The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log ChV (mmol/L) = -0.6752 (log Kow) - 0.6472

The ChV is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 4 + 3; and the Coefficient of Determination
(R2) = 0.8698. To convert the ChV from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight
of the compound.

DAPHNID ChV

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The daphnid ChV values used to develop this SAR were measured and the octanol water
partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program, KOWWIN (Version
1.67). Based on observed effects for daphnids, this chemical class is not expressing excess
toxicity compared to neutral organics. The class-specific SAR equation is yielding lower toxicity
values than estimated from baseline toxicity (neutral organics), which may be related to testing
artifacts. These chemicals may be acting in a manner similar to neutral organics. Therefore,
either the empirically based class-specific DChV equation or the neutral organics DChV
equation would be appropriate to estimate toxicity. The class-specific SAR equation is:

Log ChV (mmol/L) = -0.7554 (log Kow) + 0.7896

The ChV is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 12 + 15; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2)
= 0.8564. To convert the ChV from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the
compound.

GREEN ALGAE ChV

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The green algae chronic values (ChV) used to develop this SAR were measured and the
octanol water partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program,
KOWWIN (Version 1.67). The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log ChV (mmol/L) = -0.5583 (log Kow) - 0.4017

The ChV is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 13 + 5; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) =
0.744. To convert the ChV from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the
compound.

Maximum Kow: 8.0
Maximum MW: 1,000

APPLICATIONS:
This SAR may be used to estimate toxicity for the following esters:
      1. Acetates
      2. Benzoates
      3. Dicarboxylic aliphatics
      4. Phthalates derived from aliphatic alcohols and phenol.

LIMITATIONS:
If the log Kow value is greater than 8.0, or if the compound is solid and the ChV exceeds the
water solubility by 10X, no effects at saturation are predicted.

FISH (SW) 96-h LC50 (Mortality)

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The saltwater fish 96-h LC50 values used to develop this SAR were measured and the
octanol water partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program,
KOWWIN (Version 1.67). The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log 96-h LC50 (mmol/L) = -0.6106 (log Kow) + 0.5295

The LC50 is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 6 + 1; and the Coefficient of
Determination (R2) = 0.9019. To convert the LC50 from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the
molecular weight of the compound.

MYSID SHRIMP (SW) 96-h LC50 (Mortality)

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The saltwater mysid shrimp 96-h LC50 values used to develop this SAR were measured
and the octanol water partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer
program, KOWWIN (Version 1.67). The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log 96-h LC50 (mmol/L) = -0.8246 (log Kow) + 0.9503

The LC50 is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 4 + 1; and the Coefficient of
Determination (R2) = 0.9236. To convert the LC50 from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the
molecular weight of the compound.

FISH (SW) ChV

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The fish (SW) chronic values (ChV) used to develop this SAR were measured and the
octanol water partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program,
KOWWIN (Version 1.67). The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log ChV (mmol/L) = -0.5324 (log Kow) - 0.4705

The ChV is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 0 + 2; and the Coefficient of Determination
(R2) = N/A. To convert the ChV from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of
the compound.

MYSID SHRIMP (SW) ChV

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The saltwater mysid shrimp ChV values used to develop this SAR were measured and
the octanol water partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer
program, KOWWIN (Version 1.67). Based on observed effects for mysid shrimp, this
chemical class is not expressing excess toxicity compared to neutral organics. The
class-specific SAR equation is yielding lower toxicity values than estimated from
baseline toxicity (neutral organics), which may be related to testing artifacts. These
chemicals may be acting in a manner similar to neutral organics. Therefore, either the
empirically based class-specific M96(SW) equation or the neutral organics M96(SW)
equation would be appropriate to estimate toxicity. The class-specific SAR equation is:

Log ChV (mmol/L) = -1.7097x + 4.5873

The ChV is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 1 + 1; and the Coefficient of Determination
(R2) = N/A. To convert the ChV from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of
the compound.

Daphnia ChV

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
No adequate data were available for halo alcohols daphnid chronic value (ChV) SAR.
Predictions for this endpoint were estimated using the acute-to-chronic ratio and were
based on the acute daphnid SAR for halo alcohols. Based on observed effects for
daphnids, this chemical class is not expressing excess toxicity compared to neutral
organics. The class-specific SAR equation is yielding similar toxicity values than
estimated from baseline toxicity (neutral organics), which may be related to testing
artifacts. These chemicals may be acting in a manner similar to neutral organics.
Therefore, either the empirically based class-specific DChV equation or the neutral
organics DChV equation would be appropriate to estimate toxicity. The class-specific
SAR equation is:

Log Daphnia ChV (mmol/L) = -0.7001 (log Kow) - 0.2196

The ChV is in millimoles per liter (mM/L). To convert the ChV from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the
molecular weight of the compound.

(Version 1.67). The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log ChV (mmol/L) = -0.1435 (log Kow) - 3.5124

The ChV is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 1 + 1; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) =
N/A. To convert the ChV from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the compound.

Maximum Kow: 8.0

DAPHNID 48-h LC50

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The daphnid 48-h LC50 values used to develop this SAR were measured and the
octanol water partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program,
KOWWIN (Version 1.67). Based on observed effects for daphnids, this chemical class is
not expressing excess toxicity compared to neutral organics. The class-specific SAR
equation is yielding similar toxicity values to baseline toxicity (neutral organics), which
may be related to testing artifacts. Therefore, either the empirically based class-specific
D48 equation or the neutral organics D48 equation would be appropriate to estimate
toxicity. The class-specific SAR equation is:

Log 48-h LC50 (mmol/L) = -0.4459 (log Kow) - 0.2431

The LC50 is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 5 + 1; and the Coefficient of
Determination (R2) = 0.7564. To convert the LC50 from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the
molecular weight of the compound.

DAPHNID ChV

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The daphnid ChV values used to develop this SAR were measured and the octanol
water partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program,
KOWWIN (Version 1.67). Based on observed effects for daphnids, this chemical class is
not expressing excess toxicity compared to neutral organics. The class-specific SAR
equation is yielding similar toxicity values than estimated from baseline toxicity (neutral
organics), which may be related to testing artifacts. These chemicals may be acting in a
manner similar to neutral organics. Therefore, either the empirically based class-specific
DChV equation or the neutral organics DChV equation would be appropriate to estimate
toxicity. The class-specific SAR equation is:

Log ChV (mmol/L) = -0.6495 (log Kow) - 0.2367

The ChV is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 6 + 1; and the Coefficient of Determination
(R2) = 0.7797. To convert the ChV from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight
of the compound.

FISH (SW) 96-h LC50 (Mortality)

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The saltwater fish 96-h LC50 values used to develop this SAR were measured and the
octanol water partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program,
KOWWIN (Version 1.67). The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log 96-h LC50 (mmol/L) = -0.5014 (log Kow) – 0.1091

The LC50 is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 3 + 1; and the Coefficient of
Determination (R2) = 0.8918. To convert the LC50 from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the
molecular weight of the compound.

FISH 96-h LC50 (Mortality)

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The fish 96-h LC50 values used to develop this SAR were measured and the octanol
water partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program,
KOWWIN (Version 1.67). Based on observed effects for fish, this chemical class is not
expressing excess toxicity compared to neutral organics. The class-specific SAR
equation is yielding similar toxicity values than estimated from baseline toxicity (neutral
organics), which may be related to testing artifacts. These chemicals may be acting in a
manner similar to neutral organics. Therefore, either the empirically based class-specific
F96 equation or the neutral organics F96 equation would be appropriate to estimate
toxicity. The class-specific SAR equation is:

Log 96-h LC50 (mmol/L) = -0.8925 (log Kow) + 1.7372

The LC50 is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 6+1; and the Coefficient of Determination
(R2) = 0.9355. To convert the LC50 from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight
of the compound.

DAPHNID 48-h LC50

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The daphnid 48-h LC50 values used to develop this SAR were measured, and the
octanol water partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program,
KOWWIN (Version 1.67). The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log 48-h LC50 (mmol/L) = -0.684 (log Kow) + 0.5346

The LC50 is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 4 + 1; and the Coefficient of
Determination (R2) = 0.6537. To convert the LC50 from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the
molecular weight of the compound.

FISH ChV

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
No adequate data were available for the haloacids fish chronic value (ChV) SAR.
Predictions for this endpoint were estimated using the acute-to-chronic ratio, and were
based on the acute fish SAR for haloacids. Based on observed effects for fish, this
chemical class is not expressing excess toxicity compared to neutral organics. The
class-specific SAR equation is yielding similar toxicity values than estimated from
baseline toxicity (neutral organics), which may be related to testing artifacts. These
chemicals may be acting in a manner similar to neutral organics. Therefore, either the
empirically based class-specific FChV equation or the neutral organics FChV equation
would be appropriate to estimate toxicity. The class-specific SAR equation is:

Log ChV (mmol/L) = -0.8672 (log Kow) + 0.7372

The ChV is in millimoles per liter (mM/L). To convert the ChV from mM/L to mg/L,
multiply by the molecular weight of the compound.

DAPHNID ChV

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The daphnid chronic value (ChV) values used to develop this SAR were measured, and
the octanol water partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer

The ChV is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 1 + 1; and the Coefficient of Determination

GREEN ALGAE ChV

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The green algae chronic values (ChV) used to develop this SAR were measured, and
the octanol water partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer
program, KOWWIN (Version 1.67). The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log ChV (mmol/L) = -0.0628 (log Kow) - 4.1532

The ChV is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 2 + 1; and the Coefficient of Determination
(R2) = 0.9892. To convert the ChV from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight
of the compound.

GREEN ALGAE 96-h EC50

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
No adequate data were available for the halo epoxides green algae 96-h EC50 SAR.
Predictions for this endpoint were estimated using the acute-to-chronic ratio, and were
based on the green algae ChV SAR for halo epoxides. The SAR equation used to
estimate toxicity is:

Log 96-h EC50 (mmol/L) = -0.579 (log Kow) – 0.2646

The EC50 is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 0 + 2; and the Coefficient of
Determination (R2) = N/A. To convert the EC50 from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the
molecular weight of the compound.

DAPHNID 48-h LC50

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The daphnid 48-h LC50 values used to develop this SAR were measured and the octanol water
partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program, KOWWIN (Version
1.67). The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log 48-h LC50 (mmol/L) = -0.2626 (log Kow) – 1.5969

The LC50 is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 1 + 1; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) =
N/A. To convert the LC50 from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the
compound.

FISH ChV

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
No adequate data were available for halo ethers fish chronic value (ChV) SAR. Predictions for
this endpoint were estimated using the acute-to-chronic ratio and were based on the acute fish
SAR for halo ethers. The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log ChV (mmol/L) = -0.805 (log Kow) + 0.2396

The ChV is in millimoles per liter (mM/L). To convert the ChV from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the
molecular weight of the compound.

FISH ChV

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The fish chronic values (ChV) used to develop this SAR were measured and the octanol water partition
coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program, KOWWIN (Version 1.67). The SAR
equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log ChV (mmol/L) = -0.5728 (log Kow) – 1.6173

The ChV is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 1 + 1; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) = N/A. To
convert the ChV from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the compound.

DAPHNID 48-h LC50

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The daphnid 48-h LC50 values used to develop this SAR were measured and the
octanol water partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program,
KOWWIN (Version 1.67). The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log 48-h LC50 (mmol/L) = -0.1354 (log Kow) - 2.2329

The LC50 is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 1 + 1; and the Coefficient of
Determination (R2) = N/A. To convert the LC50 from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the
molecular weight of the compound.

Application:                                      This SAR may be used to estimate toxicity for haloketones with 2
                                                  free hydrogens on the halogen carbon. If the halogen carbon has

                                 chemical.

Limitations:                     If the log Kow value is greater than 5.0, or if the compound is solid
                                 and the LC50 exceeds the water solubility by 10X, no effects at

DAPHNID 48-h LC50

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The daphnid 48-h LC50 values used to develop this SAR were measured and the octanol water
partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program, KOWWIN (Version
1.67). The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log 48-h LC50 (mmol/L) = -0.1113 (log Kow) – 2.3616

The LC50 is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 6 + 1; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) =
0.6303. To convert the LC50 from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the
compound.

DAPHNID ChV

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
No adequate data were available for halopyridines daphnid chronic value (ChV) SAR.
Predictions for this endpoint were estimated using the acute-to-chronic ratio and were based on
the acute daphnid SAR for halopyridines. The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log ChV (mmol/L) = -0.3695 (log Kow) – 2.8643

The ChV is in millimoles per liter (mM/L). To convert the ChV from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the
molecular weight of the compound.

Application:
This SAR may be used to estimate toxicity for hydrazines, hydrazones, semicarbazides,
thiosemicarbazides, semicarbazones, thiosemicarbazones.

Limitations:
Hydrazines that are 10 times less toxic than predicted by this SAR are those hydrazines
that have a carboxylic acid substitution: butanedioic acid mono-(2,2-dimethylhydrazide)

If the log Kow value is greater than 5.0, or if the compound is solid and the LC50
exceeds the water solubility by 10X, no effects at saturation are predicted.

If the log Kow value is greater than 5.0 and less than 6.6, use the neutral organics fish

GREEN ALGAE 96-h EC50 (Growth)

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The green algae 96-h EC50 values used to develop this SAR were measured and the
octanol water partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program,
KOWWIN (Version 1.67). The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log 96-h EC50 (mmol/L) = -0.3158 (log Kow) – 1.9586

The EC50 is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 2 + 1; and the Coefficient of
Determination (R2) = 0.9302. To convert the EC50 from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the
molecular weight of the compound.

Maximum Kow:                                  8.0
Maximum MW:                                   1000

                     n= 2+ 1


Application:
This SAR may be used to estimate toxicity for hydrazines. Algae SAR equations for
subclasses of semicarbazides (e.g., alkylsemicarbazide and arylsemicarbazide) can be
found below; however, data for these SARs were retrieved from studies using 6-hour
exposures and may not be fully comparable to the above 72-hour green algae study.
Evidence for varying toxicity for semicarbazides was available (Odenkirchen & Nabholz,
1989) and thus, these SARs will be further investigated.

Limitations:
Hydrazines that are significantly less toxic than predicted by this SAR are those
hydrazines that have a carboxylic acid substitution: butanedioic acid mono-(2,2'-
dimethylhydrazide).
If the log Kow value is greater than 8.0, or if the compound is solid and the ChV exceeds
the water solubility by 10X, no effects at saturation are predicted.

Application:
This SAR may be used to estimate toxicity for aryl semicarbazides with ortho
substituents on the aryl group, including thiosemicarbazides, semicarbazones,
thiosemicarbazones, and hydrazones.

Limitations:
Arylsemicarbazides that are significantly more toxic than predicted by this SAR include
4-(o-hydroxyphenyl)-semicarbazide, with 30X excess toxicity.

GREEN ALGAE 6-h EC50

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The fish 96-h LC50 values used to develop this SAR were measured and the
octanol water partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer
program, KOWWIN (Version 1.67). The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity
is:

Log 6-h EC50 (mmol/L) = - 1.1336

The LC50 is in millimoles per liter (mM/L). To convert the LC50 from mM/L to
mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the compound.

FISH 96-h LC50 (Mortality)

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The fish 96-h LC50 values used to develop this SAR were measured and the octanol water
partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program, KOWWIN (Version
1.67). The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log 96-h LC50 (mmol/L) = -0.2015 (log Kow) - 2.6301

The LC50 is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 6 + 1; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) =
0.4766. To convert the LC50 from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the
compound.

FISH ChV

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
No adequate data were available for the hydroquinones fish chronic value (ChV) SAR endpoint.
Predictions for this endpoint were estimated using the acute-to-chronic ratio, and were based on
the acute fish SAR for hydroquinones. The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log ChV (mmol/L) = -0.3212 (log Kow) - 3.6301

The ChV is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 0 + 2; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) =
N/A. To convert the ChV from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the compound.

DAPHNID 48-h LC50

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The daphnid 48-h LC50 values used to develop this SAR were measured and the octanol water partition
coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program, KOWWIN (Version 1.67). The SAR
equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log 48-h LC50 (mmol/L) = -0.3772 (log Kow) – 1.1528

The LC50 is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 4 + 1; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) = 0.402.
To convert the LC50 from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the compound.

DAPHNID 48-h LC50

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The daphnid 48-h LC50 values used to develop this SAR were measured and the
octanol water partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer
program, KOWWIN (Version 1.67). The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity
is:

Log 48-h LC50 (mmol/L) = -0.5479 (log Kow) – 0.1326

The LC50 is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 3 + 2; and the Coefficient of
Determination (R2) = 0.9852. To convert the LC50 from mM/L to mg/L, multiply
by the molecular weight of the compound.

DAPHNID ChV

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The daphnid chronic values (ChV) used to develop this SAR were measured and
the octanol water partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer
program, KOWWIN (Version 1.67). The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity
is:

Log ChV (mmol/L) = -0.677 (log Kow) – 0.4043

The ChV is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 1 + 1; and the Coefficient of
Determination (R2) = N/A. To convert the ChV from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the
molecular weight of the compound.

DAPHNID 48-h LC50 (Mortality)

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The daphnid 48-h LC50 values used to develop this SAR were measured and the octanol water
partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program, KOWWIN (Version
1.67). The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log 48-h LC50 (mmol/L) = -0.4883 (log Kow) – 1.7986

The LC50 is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 2; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) = N/A.
To convert the LC50 from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the compound.

FISH 96-h LC50 (Mortality)

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The fish 96-h LC50 values used to develop this SAR were measured and the octanol water partition
coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program, KOWWIN (Version 1.67). The SAR
equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log 96-h LC50 (mmol/L) = –0.6286 (log Kow) + 0.3632

The LC50 is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 2 + 1; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) = 0.999. To
convert the LC50 from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the compound.

for ketone alcohols. The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log ChV (mmol/L) = -0.6213 (log Kow) - 0.8495

The ChV is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 0 + 2; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) = N/A. To
convert the ChV from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the compound.

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The daphnia 48-h LC50 values used to develop this SAR were measured and the octanol water
partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program, KOWWIN (Version
1.67). The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log 48-h LC50 (mmol/L) = -0.4861 (log Kow) – 2.5069

The LC50 is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 1 + 1; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) =
N/A. To convert the LC50 from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the compound.

GREEN ALGAE 96-h EC50

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The green algae 96-h EC50 values used to develop this SAR were measured and the octanol
water partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program, KOWWIN
(Version 1.67). The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log 96-h EC50 (mmol/L) = -0.4634 (log Kow) - 1.0041

The EC50 is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 1 + 1; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) =
N/A. To convert the LC50 from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the compound.

DAPHNID 48-h LC50 (Mortality)

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The daphnid 48-h LC50 values used to develop this SAR were measured and the
octanol water partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program,
KOWWIN (Version 1.67). The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log 48-h LC50 (mmol/L) = -0.5516 (log Kow) - 0.152

The LC50 is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 2 + 1; and the Coefficient of
Determination (R2) = N/A. To convert the LC50 from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the
molecular weight of the compound.

ALGAE ChV

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
No adequate data were available for melamine algae chronic value (ChV) SAR. Predictions
for this endpoint were estimated using the acute-to-chronic ratio and were based on the acute
algae SAR for melamine. The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log ChV (mmol/L) = -0.5332 (log Kow) - 0.3945

The ChV is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 0 + 2; and the Coefficient of
Determination (R2) = N/A. To convert the ChV from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the
molecular weight of the compound.

GREEN ALGAE 96-h EC50

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The green algae 96-h EC50 values used to develop this SAR were measured and the octanol
water partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program, KOWWIN
(Version 1.67). The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log 96-h EC50 (mmol/L) = -0.2698 (log Kow) - 2.2432

The EC50 is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 1 + 2; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) =
N/A. To convert the EC50 from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the
compound.

DAPHNID 48-h LC50

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The daphnid 48-h LC50 values used to develop this SAR were measured, and the octanol water
partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program, KOWWIN (Version
1.67). The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log 48-h LC50 (mmol/L) = -0.56 (log Kow) – 0.0124

The LC50 is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 2 + 1; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) =
0.9706. To convert the EC50 from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the
compound.

FISH ChV

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The fish chronic values (ChV) used to develop this SAR were measured, and the octanol water
partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program, KOWWIN (Version
1.67). Based on observed effects for fish, this chemical class is not expressing excess toxicity
compared to neutral organics. The class-specific SAR equation is yielding toxicity values similar
to baseline toxicity (neutral organics), which may be related to testing artifacts. Therefore, either
the empirically based class-specific FChV equation or the neutral organics FChV equation may
be appropriate to estimate toxicity. The class-specific SAR equation is:

Log ChV (mmol/L) = -0.8167 (log Kow) + 0.3771

The ChV is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 2 + 1; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) =
0.9126. To convert the ChV from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the
compound.

GREEN ALGAE ChV

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The green algae chronic values (ChV) used to develop this SAR were measured, and the octanol
water partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program, KOWWIN
(Version 1.67). The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log ChV (mmol/L) = -0.3813 (log Kow) – 1.6099

The ChV is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 1 + 1; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) =
N/A. To convert the ChV from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the compound.

Maximum Kow: 8.0

FISH 96-h LC50 (Mortality)

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The fish 96-h LC50 values used to develop this SAR were measured and the octanol water
partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program, KOWWIN (Version
1.67). The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log 96-h LC50 (mmol/L) = –0.0783 (log Kow) – 2.6665

The LC50 is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 4 + 1; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) =
0.0913. To convert the LC50 from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the
compound.

DAPHNID 48-h LC50 (Mortality)

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
Data were insufficient to develop a nereistoxin analogues QSAR for acute daphnid toxicity.
Available data indicate that nereistoxins may be 8x to >1000x more toxic then aliphatic amines
and 265x to >1000x more toxic then neutral organics. Alternative predictive methods such as
chemical analog analysis should be applied to estimate this endpoint.

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
No adequate data were available for the nereistoxin analogues fish chronic value (ChV) SAR
endpoint. Predictions for this endpoint were estimated using the acute-to-chronic ratio, and were
based on the acute fish SAR for nereistoxin analogues. The SAR equation used to estimate
toxicity is:

Log ChV (mmol/L) = -0.3167 (log Kow) – 3.6665

The ChV is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 0 + 2; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) =
N/A. To convert the ChV from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the compound.

GREEN ALGAE ChV

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The green algae chronic values (ChV) used to develop this SAR were measured and the octanol
water partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program, KOWWIN
(Version 1.67). The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log ChV (mmol/L) = -0.4522 (log Kow) – 1.0423

The ChV is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 1 + 1; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) =
N/A. To convert the ChV from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the compound.

FISH 14-d LC50

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The fish 14-d LC50 values used to develop this SAR were measured and the octanol water
partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program, KOWWIN (Version
1.67). The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log 14-d LC50 (mmol/L) = -0.8777 log Kow + 1.688

The LC50 is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 64 + 5; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) =
0.9261. To convert the LC50 from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the
compound.

Maximum Kow: 6.0
Maximum MW: 1000

DAPHNID 48-h LC50

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The daphnid 48-h LC50 values used to develop this SAR were measured and the octanol water
partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program, KOWWIN (Version
1.67). The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log 48-h LC50 = -0.8588 (log Kow) + 1.386

The LC50 is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 99 + 31; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2)
= 0.7735. To convert the LC50 from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the
compound.

Maximum Kow: 5.0
Maximum MW: 1000

GREEN ALGAE 96-h EC50

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The green algae 96-h EC50 values used to develop this SAR were measured and the octanol
water partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program, KOWWIN
(Version 1.67). The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log 96-h EC50 (mmol/L) = -0.8132 log Kow + 1.2318

The EC50 is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 43 + 9; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) =
0.6313. To convert the EC50 from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the
compound.

Maximum Kow: 6.4
Maximum MW: 1000

FISH ChV

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The fish chronic values (ChV) used to develop this SAR were measured and the octanol water
partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program, KOWWIN (Version
1.67). The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log ChV (mmol/L) = - 0.8508 log Kow + 0.6063

The ChV is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 46 + 7; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) =
0.7393. To convert the ChV from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the
compound.

Maximum Kow: 8.0
Maximum MW: 1000

DAPHNID ChV

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The daphnid ChV values used to develop this SAR were measured and the octanol water
partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program, KOWWIN (Version
1.67). The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log 16-d ChV (mmol/L) = - 0.7464 log Kow + 0.1507

The ChV is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 26 + 1; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) =
0.8728. To convert the ChV from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the
compound.

Maximum Kow: 8.0
Maximum MW: 1000

Application:
Solvents, non-reactive, non-ionizable neutral organic compounds

1. Alcohols
2. Acetals
3. Ketones
4. Ethers
5. Alkyl halides
6. Aryl halides
7. Aromatic hydrocarbons
8. Halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons
9. Halogenated aliphatic hydrocarbons
10. Sulfides and di-sulfides

Limitations:
If the log Kow value is greater than 8.0, or if the compound is solid and the ChV exceeds the
water solubility by 10X, no effects at saturation are predicted.

GREEN ALGAE ChV

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The green algae chronic values (ChV) used to develop this SAR were measured and the octanol
water partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program, KOWWIN
(Version 1.67). The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log ChV (mmol/L) = -0.6029 log Kow + 0.1648

The ChV is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 34 + 5; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) =
0.6971. To convert the ChV from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the
compound.

Maximum Kow: 8.0
Maximum MW: 1000

FISH (SW) 96-h LC50

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The saltwater fish 96-h LC50 values used to develop this SAR were measured and the octanol
water partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program, KOWWIN
(Version 1.67). The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log 96-h LC50 (mmol/L) = - 0.8955 log Kow + 1.8056

The LC50 is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 24 + 1; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) =
0.6575. To convert the LC50 from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the
compound.

Maximum Kow: 5.0
Maximum MW: 1000

FISH (SW) ChV

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The saltwater fish chronic values (ChV) used to develop this SAR were measured and the octanol
water partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program, KOWWIN
(Version 1.67). The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log ChV (mmol/L) = - 0.6303 log Kow + 0.3108

The ChV is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); and N = 2. To convert the ChV from mM/L to mg/L,
multiply by the molecular weight of the compound.

Maximum Kow: 8.0
Maximum MW: 1000

FISH 96-h LC50 (Mortality)

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The fish 96-h LC50 values used to develop this SAR were measured and the octanol water
partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program, KOWWIN (Version
1.67). The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log 96-h LC50 (mmol/L) = -0.314 (log Kow) - 1.2102

The LC50 is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 3 + 1; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) =
0.9866. To convert the LC50 from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the
compound.

DAPHNID ChV

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
No adequate data were available for the nicotinoids daphnid chronic value (ChV) SAR.
Predictions for this endpoint were estimated using the acute-to-chronic ratio, and were based on
the acute daphnid SAR for nicotinoids. The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log ChV (mmol/L) = -0.2731 (log Kow) – 3.6354

The ChV is in millimoles per liter (mM/L). To convert the ChV from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the
molecular weight of the compound.

GREEN ALGAE 96-h EC50

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
No adequate data were available for the oxetanes green algae 96-h EC50 SAR endpoint.
Predictions for this endpoint were estimated using the acute-to-chronic ratio, and were based on
the chronic green algae SAR for oxetanes. The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log EC50 (mmol/L) = -0.9432 (log Kow) + 2.0666

The EC50 is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 0 + 2; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) =
N/A. To convert the ChV from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the compound.

FISH 96-h LC50 (Mortality)

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The fish 96-h LC50 values used to develop this SAR were measured and the octanol water
partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program, KOWWIN (Version
1.67). Based on observed effects for fish, this chemical class is not expressing excess toxicity
compared to neutral organics. The class-specific SAR equation is yielding toxicity values similar
to baseline toxicity (neutral organics), which may be related to testing artifacts. Therefore, either
the empirically based class-specific F96 equation or the neutral organics F96 equation would be
appropriate to estimate toxicity. The class-specific SAR equation is:


Log 96-h LC50 (mmol/L) = –0.8163 (log Kow) + 1.3014

The LC50 is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 1 + 4; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) =
N/A. To convert the LC50 from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the compound.

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The daphnid 48-h LC50 values used to develop this SAR were measured and the octanol water

FISH ChV

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
No adequate data were available for the peroxy esters fish chronic value (ChV) SAR endpoint.
Predictions for this endpoint were estimated using the acute-to-chronic ratio, and were based on
the acute fish SAR for peroxy esters. Based on observed effects for fish, this chemical class is
not expressing excess toxicity compared to neutral organics. The class-specific SAR equation is
yielding toxicity values similar to baseline toxicity (neutral organics), which may be related to
testing artifacts. Therefore, either the empirically based class-specific FChV equation or the
neutral organics FChV equation would be appropriate to estimate toxicity. The class-specific SAR
equation is:


Log ChV (mmol/L) = -0.8075 (log Kow) + 0.2603

The ChV is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 0 + 2; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) =

DAPHNID ChV

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The daphnid ChV values used to develop this SAR were measured and the octanol water
partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program, KOWWIN (Version
1.67). Based on observed effects for daphnids, this chemical class is not expressing excess
toxicity compared to neutral organics. The class-specific SAR equation is yielding lower toxicity
values than estimated from baseline toxicity (neutral organics), which may be related to testing
artifacts. Therefore, either the empirically based class-specific DChV equation or the neutral
organics DChV equation would be appropriate to estimate toxicity. The class-specific SAR
equation is:

Log ChV (mmol/L) = -0.7862 (log Kow) + 0.4698

The ChV is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 1 + 1; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) =
N/A. To convert the ChV from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the compound.

GREEN ALGAE 96-h EC50 (Growth)

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The green algae 96-h EC50 values used to develop this SAR were measured and the octanol
water partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program, KOWWIN
(Version 1.67). The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log 96-h EC50 (mmol/L) = -0.4798 (log Kow) – 0.8994

The EC50 is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 1 + 1; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) =
N/A. To convert the EC50 from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the compound.

FISH ChV

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
No adequate data were available for the phenol amines fish chronic value (ChV) SAR endpoint.

FISH 96-h LC50 (Mortality)

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The fish 96-h LC50 values used to develop this SAR were measured and the octanol water partition
coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program, KOWWIN (Version 1.67). The SAR
equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log 96-h LC50 (mmol/L) = -0.5957 (log Kow) - 0.0798

The LC50 is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 24 + 12; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) = 0.823.
To convert the LC50 from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the compound.

Maximum Kow: 7.0
Maximum MW: 1000

Application:
This SAR may be used to estimate toxicity for phenols, poly.

Limitations:
If the log Kow value is greater than 7.0, or if the compound is solid and the LC50 exceeds the water
solubility by 10X, no effects at saturation are predicted.

DAPHNID 48-h LC50

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The daphnid 48-h LC50 values used to develop this SAR were measured and the octanol water partition
coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program, KOWWIN (Version 1.67). Based on
observed effects for daphnids, this chemical class is not expressing excess toxicity compared to neutral
organics. The class-specific SAR equation is yielding similar toxicity values than estimated from baseline
toxicity (neutral organics), which may be related to testing artifacts. These chemicals may be acting in a
manner similar to neutral organics. Therefore, either the empirically based class-specific D48 equation or
the neutral organics D48 equation would be appropriate to estimate toxicity. The class-specific SAR
equation is:

Log 48-h LC50 (mmol/L) = -0.7683 (log Kow) + 1.1595

The LC50 is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 5 + 6; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) = 0.8648.
To convert the LC50 from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the compound.

FISH ChV

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The fish chronic values (ChV) used to develop this SAR were measured and the octanol water partition
coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program, KOWWIN (Version 1.67). Based on
observed effects for fish, this chemical class is not expressing excess toxicity compared to neutral
organics. The class-specific SAR equation is yielding lower toxicity values than estimated from baseline
toxicity (neutral organics), which may be related to testing artifacts. These chemicals may be acting in a
manner similar to neutral organics. Therefore, either the empirically based class-specific FChV equation
or the neutral organics FChV equation would be appropriate to estimate toxicity. The class-specific SAR
equation is:

Log ChV (mmol/L) = -0.6618 (log Kow) - 0.2069

The ChV is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 3 + 3; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) = 0.8333.
To convert the ChV from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the compound.

DAPHNID ChV

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The daphnid chronic values (ChV) used to develop this SAR were measured and the octanol water
partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program, KOWWIN (Version 1.67). Based
on observed effects for daphnids, this chemical class is not expressing excess toxicity compared to
neutral organics. The class-specific SAR equation is yielding lower toxicity values than estimated from
baseline toxicity (neutral organics), which may be related to testing artifacts. These chemicals may be
acting in a manner similar to neutral organics. Therefore, either the empirically based class-specific
DChV equation or the neutral organics DChV equation would be appropriate to estimate toxicity. The
class-specific SAR equation is:

Log ChV (mmol/L) = -0.7946 (log Kow) + 0.785

The ChV is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 3 + 1; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) = 0.936. To
convert the ChV from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the compound.

GREEN ALGAE ChV

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The green algae chronic values (ChV) used to develop this SAR were measured and the octanol water
partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program, KOWWIN (Version 1.67). The
SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log ChV (mmol/L) = -0.274 (log Kow) - 2.0044

The ChV is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 4 + 4; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) = 0.0717.
To convert the ChV from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the compound.

Application:
This SAR may be used to estimate toxicity for phenols.

Limitations:
Phenols which contain the following groups may have excess toxicity compared with the values predicted
by this SAR:

1,2-di(OH) groups (e.g., catechol)

If the log Kow value is greater than 7.0, or if the compound is solid and the LC50 exceeds the water
solubility by 10X, no effects at saturation are predicted.

DAPHNID 48-h LC50 (Mortality)

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The daphnid 48-h LC50 values used to develop this SAR were measured and the octanol water partition
coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program, KOWWIN (Version 1.67). The SAR
equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log 48-h LC50 (mmol/L) = - 0.5667 (log Kow) - 0.1481

The LC50 is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 63 + 7; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) = 0.7034.
To convert the LC50 from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the compound.

Maximum Kow: 7
Maximum MW: 1000

Application:
This SAR may be used to estimate toxicity for phenols.

Limitations:
Phenols which contain the following groups may have excess toxicity compared with the values predicted
by this SAR:
1,2-di(OH) groups (e.g., catechol)

If the log Kow value is greater than 5.5, or if the compound is solid and the LC50 exceeds the water
solubility by 10X, no effects at saturation are predicted.

GREEN ALGAE 96-h EC50 (Growth)

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The green algae 96-h EC50 values used to develop this SAR were measured and the octanol water
partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program, KOWWIN (Version 1.67). The
SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log 96-h EC50 (mmol/L) = -0.6089 (log Kow) + 0.599

The EC50 is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 40 + 4; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) = 0.6748.
To convert the EC50 from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the compound.

Maximum Kow: 7
Maximum MW: 1000

Application:
This SAR may be used to estimate toxicity for phenols.

Limitations:
Phenols which contain the following groups may have excess toxicity compared with the values predicted
by this SAR:

1,2-di(OH) groups (e.g., catechol)

If the log Kow value is greater than 6.4, or if the compound is solid and the EC50 exceeds the water
solubility by 10X, no effects at saturation are predicted.

FISH ChV

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The fish chronic values (ChV) used to develop this SAR were measured and the octanol water partition
coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program, KOWWIN (Version 1.67). The SAR
equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log ChV (mmol/L) = -0.5981 (log Kow) - 0.7616

The ChV is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 40; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) = 0.7369. To
convert the ChV from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the compound.

Maximum Kow: 8.0
Maximum MW: 1000

Application:
This SAR may be used to estimate toxicity for phenols.

Limitations:
Phenols which contain the following groups may have excess toxicity compared with the values predicted
by this SAR:
1,2-di(OH) groups (e.g, catechol)

If the log Kow value is greater than 8.0, or if the compound is solid and the ChV exceeds the water
solubility by 10X, no effects at saturation are predicted. A test duration of more than 30 days may result in
a lower chronic toxicity; at 60 days the toxicity will be 20x lower than predicted by this SAR for phenols
with a log Kow of 1.5 and 4x lower for phenols with a log Kow of 5.3. For an exposure of 60 days, a
separate SAR has been developed.

DAPHNID ChV

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The daphnid chronic values (ChV) used to develop this SAR were measured and the octanol water
partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program, KOWWIN (Version 1.67). The
SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log ChV (mmol/L) = -0.5674 (log Kow) - 0.8674

The ChV is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 14; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) = 0.7016. To
convert the ChV from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the compound.

Maximum Kow: 8.0
Maximum MW: 1000

Application:
This SAR may be used to estimate toxicity for phenols.

Limitations:
Phenols which contain the following groups may have excess toxicity compared with the values predicted
by this SAR:

1,2-di(OH) groups (e.g., catechol)

3,5-Dimethoxyphenol has an excess toxicity of 18x that predicted by this SAR.
If the log Kow value is greater than 8.0, or if the compound is solid and the ChV exceeds the water
solubility by 10X, no effects at saturation are predicted.

GREEN ALGAE ChV

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The green algae chronic values (ChV) used to develop this SAR were measured and the octanol water
partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program, KOWWIN (Version 1.67). The
SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log ChV (mmol/L) = -0.6144 (log Kow) + 0.2819

The ChV is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 19 + 4; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) = 0.6711.
To convert the ChV from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the compound.

Maximum Kow: 8.0
Maximum MW: 1000

Application:
This SAR may be used to estimate toxicity for phenols.

Limitations:
Phenols which contain the following groups may have excess toxicity compared with the values predicted
by this SAR:

1,2-di(OH) groups (e.g., catechol)

If the log Kow value is greater than 8.0, or if the compound is solid and the ChV exceeds the water
solubility by 10X, no effects at saturation are predicted.

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The fish (sw) 96-h LC50 values used to develop this SAR were measured and the octanol water partition
coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program, KOWWIN (Version 1.67). The SAR
equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log 96-h LC50 (mmol/L) = -0.9959 (log Kow) + 1.0316

The LC50 is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 5 + 2; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) = 0.8224.
To convert the LC50 from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the compound.

EARTHWORM 14-d LC50 (Mortality)

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The earthworm 14-d-h LC50 values used to develop this SAR were measured and the octanol water
partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program, KOWWIN (Version 1.67). The
SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log 96-h EC50 (mmol/L) = -0.4089 (log Kow) + 0.7858

The LC50 is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 3; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) = 0.4052. To
convert the LC50 from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the compound.

FISH 96-h LC50 (Mortality)

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The fish 96-h LC50 values used to develop this SAR were measured and the octanol water partition
coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program, KOWWIN (Version 1.67). Based on
observed effects for fish, this chemical class is not expressing excess toxicity compared to neutral
organics. The class-specific SAR equation is yielding lower toxicity values than estimated from baseline
toxicity (neutral organics), which may be related to testing artifacts. These chemicals may be acting in a
manner similar to neutral organics. Therefore, either the empirically based class-specific F96 equation or
the neutral organics F96 equation would be appropriate to estimate toxicity. The class-specific SAR
equation is:

Log 96-h LC50 (mmol/L) = -1.0844 (log Kow) + 2.6374

The LC50 is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 2 + 1; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) = 0.9998.
To convert the LC50 from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the compound.

FISH ChV

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
No adequate data were available for the phosphine oxides fish chronic value (ChV) SAR. Predictions for
this endpoint were estimated using the acute-to-chronic ratio, and were based on the acute fish SAR for
phosphine oxides. Based on observed effects for fish, this chemical class is not expressing excess
toxicity compared to neutral organics. The class-specific SAR equation is yielding similar toxicity values
than estimated from baseline toxicity (neutral organics), which may be related to testing artifacts. These
chemicals may be acting in a manner similar to neutral organics. Therefore, either the empirically based
class-specific FChV equation or the neutral organics FChV equation would be appropriate to estimate
toxicity. The class-specific SAR equation is:

Log ChV (mmol/L) = -0.9797 (log Kow) + 1.6374

The ChV is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); and N = 0 + 2. To convert the ChV from mM/L to mg/L, multiply
by the molecular weight of the compound.

FISH ChV

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
No adequate data were available for the phthalonitriles fish chronic value (ChV) SAR endpoint.
Predictions for this endpoint were estimated using the acute-to-chronic ratio, and were based on the
acute fish SAR for phthalonitriles. The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log Fish ChV (mmol/L) = -0.6097 (log Kow) – 1.3226

The ChV is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 0 + 2; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) = N/A. To
convert the ChV from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the compound.

endpoint. Predictions for this endpoint were estimated using the acute-to-chronic ratio, and were
based on the acute fish SAR for polyaliphatic nitriles. The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity
is:

Log ChV (mmol/L) = -0.8154 (log Kow) + 0.3228

The ChV is in millimoles per liter (mM/L). To convert the ChV from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the
molecular weight of the compound.

Maximum Kow: 8
Maximum MW: 1000

GREEN ALGAE 96-h EC50

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The green algae 96-h EC50 values used to develop this SAR were measured and the
octanol water partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program,
KOWWIN (Version 1.67). The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log 96-h EC50 (mmol/L) = -0.3821 (log Kow) - 1.5638

The EC50 is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 3 + 2; and the Coefficient of
Determination (R2) = 0.9813. To convert the EC50 from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the
molecular weight of the compound.

FISH (SW) 96-h LC50 (Mortality)

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The saltwater fish 96-h LC50 values used to develop this SAR were measured and the
octanol water partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program,
KOWWIN (Version 1.67). The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log 96-h LC50 (mmol/L) = -0.2751 (log Kow) - 1.2944

The LC50 is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 1 + 1; and the Coefficient of
Determination (R2) = N/A. To convert the LC50 from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the
molecular weight of the compound.

FISH (SW) ChV

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
No adequate data were available for the polynitrobenzenes saltwater fish chronic value
(ChV) SAR. Predictions for this endpoint were estimated using this acute-to-chronic
ratio, and were based on the acute saltwater fish SAR for polynitrobenzenes. The SAR
equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log ChV (mmol/L) = -0.3156 (log Kow) - 2.2054

The ChV is in millimoles per liter (mM/L). To convert the ChV from mM/L to mg/L,
multiply by the molecular weight of the compound.

DAPHNID 48-h LC50

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The daphnid 48-h LC50 values used to develop this SAR were measured and the
octanol water partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program,
KOWWIN (Version 1.67). The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log 48-h LC50 (mmol/L) = -0.4663 (log Kow) - 0.6211

The LC50 is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 9; and the Coefficient of Determination
(R2) = 0.8576. To convert the LC50 from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight
of the compound.

GREEN ALGAE 96-h EC50

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
No adequate data were available for this polynitroanilines green algae 96-h EC50 SAR.
Predictions for this endpoint were estimated using the acute-to-chronic ratio, and were
based on the chronic green algae SAR for polynitroanilines. The SAR equation used to
estimate toxicity is:

Log 96-h EC50 (mmol/L) = -0.2167 (log Kow) - 2.5832

The EC50 is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 0 + 2; and the Coefficient of
Determination (R2) = N/A. To convert the EC50 from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the
molecular weight of the compound.

GREEN ALGAE ChV

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The green algae chronic values (ChV) used to develop this SAR were measured and the
octanol water partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program,
KOWWIN (Version 1.67). The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log Green Algae ChV (mmol/L) = -0.1778 (log Kow) – 3.2375

The ChV is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 1 + 1; and the Coefficient of Determination
(R2) = N/A. To convert the ChV from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of
the compound.

DAPHNID 48-h LC50

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The daphnid 48-h LC50 values used to develop this SAR were measured and the
octanol water partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program,
KOWWIN (Version 1.67). The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log 48-h LC50 (mmol/L) = -0.9279 (log Kow) + 0.4907

The LC50 is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 7 + 1; and the Coefficient of
Determination (R2) = 0.9353. To convert the LC50 from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the
molecular weight of the compound.

FISH ChV

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The fish chronic values (ChV) used to develop this SAR were measured and the octanol
water partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program,
KOWWIN (Version 1.67). The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log ChV (mmol/L) = -0.6868 (log Kow) – 1.1059

The ChV is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 10 + 1; and the Coefficient of
Determination (R2) = 0.865. To convert the ChV from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the
molecular weight of the compound.

DAPHNID ChV

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The daphnid ChV values used to develop this SAR were measured and the octanol
water partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program,
KOWWIN (Version 1.67). Based on observed effects for daphnids, this chemical class is not
expressing excess toxicity compared to neutral organics. The class-specific SAR equation is
yielding similar toxicity values than estimated from baseline toxicity (neutral organics), which may
be related to testing artifacts. These chemicals may be acting in a manner similar to neutral
organics. Therefore, either the empirically based class-specific DChV equation or the neutral
organics DChV equation would be appropriate to estimate toxicity. The class-specific SAR
equation is:

Log ChV (mmol/L) = -0.6439 (log Kow) - 0.4831

The ChV is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 2 + 1; and the Coefficient of Determination
(R2) = 0.9915. To convert the ChV from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight
of the compound.

FISH (SW) Chronic Value

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
No adequate data were available for the polynitrophenols saltwater fish chronic value
(ChV) SAR. Predictions for this endpoint were estimated using the acute-to-chronic ratio,
and were based on the acute saltwater fish SAR for polynitrophenols. The SAR equation
used to estimate toxicity is:

Log ChV (mmol/L) =-0.5282 (log Kow) - 0.5042

The ChV is in millimoles per liter (mM/L). To convert the ChV from mM/L to mg/L,
multiply by the molecular weight of the compound.

Daphnia ChV

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
No adequate data were available for the propargyl halides SAR daphnia chronic value (ChV)
endpoint. Predictions for this endpoint were estimated using the acute-to-chronic ratio, and were
based on the acute fish SAR for propargyl halides. The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity
is:

Log Daphnia ChV (mmol/L) = -0.7169 (log Kow) – 1.0642

The ChV is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 0 + 2; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) =
N/A. To convert the ChV from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the compound.

FISH 96-h LC50 (Mortality)

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The fish 96-h LC50 values used to develop this SAR were measured and the octanol water partition
coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program, KOWWIN (Version 1.67). Based on
observed effects for fish, this chemical class is not expressing excess toxicity compared to neutral
organics. The class-specific SAR equation is yielding similar toxicity values than estimated from baseline
toxicity (neutral organics), which may be related to testing artifacts. These chemicals may be acting in a
manner similar to neutral organics. Therefore, either the empirically based class-specific F96 equation or
the neutral organics F96 equation would be appropriate to estimate toxicity. The class-specific SAR
equation is:

Log 96-h LC50 (mmol/L) = -0.889 (log Kow) + 1.7453

The LC50 is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 8 + 1; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) = 0.9296.
To convert the LC50 from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the compound.

FISH ChV

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
No adequate data were available for the hindered propargyl alcohols fish chronic value (ChV) SAR.
Predictions for this endpoint were estimated using the acute-to-chronic ratio, and were based on the
acute fish SAR for hindered propargyl alcohols. Based on observed effects for fish, this chemical class is
not expressing excess toxicity compared to neutral organics. The class-specific SAR equation is yielding
similar toxicity values than estimated from baseline toxicity (neutral organics), which may be related to
testing artifacts. These chemicals may be acting in a manner similar to neutral organics. Therefore,
either the empirically based class-specific FChV equation or the neutral organics FChV equation would
be appropriate to estimate toxicity. The class-specific SAR equation is:

Log ChV (mmol/L) = -0.8682 (log Kow) + 0.7453

The ChV is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 0 + 1; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) = N/A. To
convert the ChV from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the compound.

DAPHNID ChV

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
No adequate data were available for the hindered propargyl alcohols daphnid chronic value (ChV) SAR.
Predictions for this endpoint were estimated using the acute-to-chronic ratio, and were based on the
acute daphnid SAR for benzyl imides. Based on observed effects for daphnids, this chemical class is not
expressing excess toxicity compared to neutral organics. The class-specific SAR equation is yielding
lower toxicity values than estimated from baseline toxicity (neutral organics), which may be related to
testing artifacts. These chemicals may be acting in a manner similar to neutral organics. Therefore,
either the empirically based class-specific DChV equation or the neutral organics DChV equation would
be appropriate to estimate toxicity. The class-specific SAR equation is:

Log ChV (mmol/L) = -1.0024 (log Kow) + 2.1989

The ChV is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 0 + 2; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) = N/A. To
convert the ChV from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the compound.

GREEN ALGAE 96-h EC50 (Growth)

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The green algae 96-h EC50 values used to develop this SAR were measured and the octanol
water partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program, KOWWIN
(Version 1.67). The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log 96-h EC50 (mmol/L) = -0.637 (log Kow) + 0.1066

The EC50 is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 1 + 1; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) =
N/A. To convert the EC50 from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the compound.

DAPHNID 48-h LC50 (Mortality)

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The daphnid 48-h LC50 values used to develop this SAR were measured and the octanol water partition
coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program, KOWWIN (Version 1.67). The SAR
equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log 48-h LC50 (mmol/L) = -0.9821 (log Kow) + 2.1461

The LC50 is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 2 + 1; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) = 0.9379.
To convert the LC50 from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the compound.

FISH 96-h LC50 (Mortality)

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The fish 96-h LC50 values used to develop this SAR were measured and the octanol water
partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program, KOWWIN (Version
1.67). The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log 96-h LC50 (mmol/L) = -0.88 (log Kow) + 0.1094

The LC50 is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 13 + 11; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2)
= 0.7405. To convert the LC50 from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the
compound.

DAPHNID 48-h LC50 (Mortality)

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The daphnid 48-h LC50 values used to develop this SAR were measured and the octanol water
partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program, KOWWIN (Version
1.67). The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log 48-h LC50 (mmol/L) = -0.2016 (log Kow) – 1.1709

The LC50 is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 3 + 4; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) =
0.1735. To convert the LC50 from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the
compound.

GREEN ALGAE 96-h EC50

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The green algae 96-h EC50 values used to develop this SAR were measured and the
octanol water partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program,
KOWWIN (Version 1.67). The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log 96-h EC50 (mmol/L) = -0.7201 (log Kow) + 0.0063

The EC50 is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 2 + 2; and the Coefficient of
Determination (R2) = 0.6767. To convert the EC50 from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the
molecular weight of the compound

FISH ChV

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
No adequate data were available for the pyrazoles fish chronic value (ChV) SAR. Predictions for
this endpoint were estimated using the acute-to-chronic ratio, and were based on the acute fish
SAR for pyrazoles. The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log ChV (mmol/L) = -0.5959 (log Kow) – 1.1119

The ChV is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 2 + 1; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) =
0.972. To convert the ChV from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the compound.

DAPHNID ChV

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
No adequate data were available for the pyrazoles daphnid chronic value (ChV) SAR.
Predictions for this endpoint were estimated using the acute-to-chronic ratio, and were based on
the acute daphnid SAR for pyrazoles. The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log ChV (mmol/L) = -0.0448 (log Kow) – 5.302

The ChV is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 2 + 1; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) =
0.0165. To convert the ChV from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the
compound.

DAPHNID 48-h LC50 (Mortality)

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The daphnid 48-h LC50 values used to develop this SAR were measured and the octanol water
partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program, KOWWIN (Version
1.67). The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log 48-h LC50 (mmol/L) = -0.5247 (log Kow) - 2.3526

The LC50 is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 21 + 3; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) =
0.3599. To convert the LC50 from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the
compound.

Maximum Kow: >7.5
Maximum MW: 1000

Application:
This SAR may be used to estimate toxicity for pyrethroids.

Limitations:
If the compound is solid and the LC50 exceeds the water solubility by 10X, no effects at
saturation are predicted.

FISH ChV

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The fish chronic values (ChV) used to develop this SAR were measured and the octanol water
partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program, KOWWIN (Version
1.67). The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log ChV (mmol/L) = -0.4778 (log Kow) – 3.8196

The ChV is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 9; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) =
0.1436. To convert the ChV from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the
compound.

GREEN ALGAE ChV

No adequate data were available for the pyrethroids SAR green algae chronic value (ChV)
endpoint. Available data (below) indicate green algae to be a less sensitive species then fish and
daphnid. Alternative predictive methods such as chemical analog analysis may be applied to
estimate this endpoint.

FISH (SW) 96-h LC50 (Mortality)

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The fish (SW) 96-h LC50 values used to develop this SAR were measured and the octanol water
partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program, KOWWIN (Version
1.67). The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log 96-h LC50 (mmol/L) = -0.794 (log Kow) - 0.3688

The LC50 is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 8 + 2; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) =
0.5793. To convert the LC50 from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the
compound.

Fish (SW) ChV

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The fish (SW) chronic values (ChV) used to develop this SAR were measured, and the octanol
water partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program, KOWWIN
(Version 1.67). The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The fish 96-h LC50 values used to develop this SAR were measured and the octanol water partition
coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program, KOWWIN (Version 1.67). The SAR
equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log 96-h LC50 (mmol/L) = -0.6919 (log Kow) + 0.6795

The LC50 is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 1 + 1; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) = N/A. To
convert the LC50 from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the compound.

FISH ChV

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
No adequate data were available for the pyridine-α-acids fish chronic value (ChV) SAR.
Predictions for this endpoint were estimated using the acute-to-chronic ratio, and were based on
the acute fish SAR for pyridine-α-acids. The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log ChV (mmol/L) = -0.7325 (log Kow) - 0.34

The ChV is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 0 + 2; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) =
N/A. To convert the ChV from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the compound.

FISH ChV

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
No adequate data were available for the quinones fish chronic value (ChV) SAR endpoint.
Predictions for this endpoint were estimated using the acute-to-chronic ratio, and were based on
the acute fish SAR for quinones. The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log ChV (mmol/L) = -0.2743 (log Kow) - 4.0053

The ChV is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 0 + 2; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) =
N/A. To convert the ChV from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the compound.

DAPHNID 48-h LC50 (Mortality)

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The daphnid 48-h LC50 values used to develop this SAR were measured and the octanol water partition
coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program, KOWWIN (Version 1.67). The SAR
equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log 48-h LC50 (mmol/L) = -0.0663 (log Kow) – 1.7507

The LC50 is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 2; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) = N/A. To
convert the LC50 from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the compound.

FISH 96-h LC50 (Mortality)

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The fish 96-h LC50 values used to develop this SAR were measured and the octanol water
partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program, KOWWIN (Version
1.67). The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log 96-h LC50 (mmol/L) = -0.2948 (log Kow) - 1.6088

The LC50 is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 4 + 1; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) =
0.3782. To convert the LC50 from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the
compound.

Log ChV (mmol/L) = -0.4706 (log Kow) – 2.0552

The ChV is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 0 + 2; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) =
N/A. To convert the ChV from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the compound.

DAPHNIA 48-h LC50

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The daphnid 48-h LC50 values used to develop this SAR were measured and the octanol water
partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program, KOWWIN (Version
1.67). The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log 48-h LC50 (mmol/L) = -0.9685 (log Kow) + 0.9774

The LC50 is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 11 + 3; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) =
0.828. To convert the LC50 from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the
compound.

Maximum Kow: 5.0
Maximum MW: 1000

APPLICATION:
This SAR may be used to estimate toxicity for substituted urea.

LIMITATIONS:
If the log Kow value is greater than 5.0, or if the compound is solid and the LC50 exceeds the
water solubility by 10X, no effects at saturation are predicted.

GREEN ALGAE 96-h EC50

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The green algae 96-h EC50 values used to develop this SAR were measured and the octanol
water partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program, KOWWIN
(Version 1.67). The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log 96-h EC50 (mmol/L) = -0.4132 (log Kow) – 2.0354

The EC50 is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 4 + 1; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) =
0.1723. To convert the EC50 from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the
compound.

Maximum Kow: 6.4
Maximum MW: 1000

FISH(SW) 96-h LC50 (Mortality)

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The fish (SW) 96-h LC50 values used to develop this SAR were measured and the octanol water
partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program, KOWWIN (Version
1.67). The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log 96-h LC50 (mmol/L) = - 0.474 (log Kow) - 0.1091

The LC50 is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 4 + 1; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) =
0.3568. To convert the LC50 from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the
compound.

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The fish (SW) chronic values (ChV) used to develop this SAR were measured and the octanol
water partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program, KOWWIN
(Version 1.67). The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log ChV (mmol/L) = -0.3895 (log Kow) – 1.6113

The ChV is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 2 + 1; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) =
0.9972. To convert the ChV from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the
compound.

Mysid (SW) ChV

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The mysid (SW) chronic values (ChV) used to develop this SAR were measured and the octanol
water partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program, KOWWIN
(Version 1.67). The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log ChV (mmol/L) = -0.9858 (log Kow) – 1.5894

The ChV is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 4 + 1; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) =
0.7634. To convert the ChV from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the
compound.

FISH ChV

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The fish chronic values (ChV) used to develop this SAR were measured and the octanol water partition
coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program, KOWWIN (Version 1.67). The SAR
equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log ChV (mmol/L) = - 0.6961 log Kow - 0.5595

The ChV is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 5 + 1; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) = 0.9366.
To convert the ChV from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the compound.

MYSID (SW) 96-h LC50 (Mortality)

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The mysid 96-h LC50 values used to develop this SAR were measured and the octanol water partition
coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program, KOWWIN (Version 1.67). The SAR
equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log 48-h LC50 (mmol/L) = -0.8306 (log Kow) + 0.6122

The LC50 is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 3 + 1; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) = 0.9393.
To convert the LC50 from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the compound.

MYSID (SW) ChV

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
No adequate data were available for the sulfonyl ureas mysid (SW) chronic value (ChV) SAR endpoint.
Predictions for this endpoint were estimated using the acute-to-chronic ratio, and were based on the
acute mysid (SW) SAR for sulfonyl ureas. The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log ChV (mmol/L) = -1.0878 (log Kow) – 0.3878

The ChV is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 0 + 2; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) = N/A. To
convert the ChV from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the compound.

DAPHNID 48-h LC50 (Mortality)

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The daphnid 48-h LC50 values used to develop this SAR were measured and the octanol water
partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program, KOWWIN (Version
1.67). The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log 48-h LC50 (mmol/L) = -0.6004 (log Kow) + 0.0918

The LC50 is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 1 + 1; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) =
N/A. To convert the LC50 from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the compound.

FISH 96-h LC50 (Mortality)

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The fish 96-h LC50 values used to develop this SAR were measured and the octanol
water partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program,
KOWWIN (Version 1.67). The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log 96-h LC50 (mmol/L) = -0.2443 (log Kow) – 1.4456

The LC50 is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 5 + 1; and the Coefficient of
Determination (R2) = 0.7239. To convert the LC50 from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the
molecular weight of the compound.

FISH ChV

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
No adequate data were available for the dithiocarbamates, free acids fish chronic value
(ChV) SAR. Predictions for this endpoint were estimated using the acute-to-chronic
ratio, and were based on the acute fish SAR for dithiocarbamates (free acids). The SAR
equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log ChV (mmol/L) = -0.4693 (log Kow) – 2.4456

The ChV is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 0 + 2; and the Coefficient of Determination
(R2) = N/A. . To convert the ChV from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of
the compound.

DAPHNID 48-h LC50

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The daphnid 48-h LC50 values used to develop this SAR were measured and the
octanol water partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program,
KOWWIN (Version 1.67). The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log 48-h LC50 (mmol/L) = - 0.2332 (log Kow) – 2.0808

The LC50 is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 5 + 2; and the Coefficient of
Determination (R2) = 0.2822. To convert the LC50 from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the
molecular weight of the compound.

GREEN ALGAE ChV

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The green algae chronic values (ChV) used to develop this SAR were measured
and the octanol water partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the
computer program, KOWWIN (Version 1.67). The SAR equation used to
estimate toxicity is:

Log Green Algae ChV (mmol/L) = -0.1033 (log Kow) – 3.8337

The ChV is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 1 + 1; and the Coefficient of Determination
(R2) = N/A. To convert the ChV from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of
the compound.

FISH 96-h LC50

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The fish 96-h LC50 values used to develop this SAR were measured and the octanol water
partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program, KOWWIN (Version
1.67). Based on observed effects for fish, this chemical class is not expressing excess toxicity
compared to neutral organics. The class-specific SAR equation is yielding similar toxicity values
than estimated from baseline toxicity (neutral organics), which may be related to testing artifacts.
Therefore, either the empirically based class-specific F96 equation or the neutral organics F96
equation would be appropriate to estimate toxicity. The class-specific SAR equation is:

Log 96-h LC50 (mmol/L) = -0.6757 (log Kow) + 0.844

The LC50 is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 27 + 1; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) =
0.5868. To convert the LC50 from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the
compound.

The daphnid 48-h LC50 values used to develop this SAR were measured and the octanol water
partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program, KOWWIN (Version
1.67). Based on observed effects for daphnid, this chemical class is not expressing excess
toxicity compared to neutral organics. The class-specific SAR equation is yielding similar toxicity
values than estimated from baseline toxicity (neutral organics), which may be related to testing
artifacts. Therefore, either the empirically based class-specific F96 equation or the neutral
organics F96 equation would be appropriate to estimate toxicity. The class-specific SAR equation
is:

Log 48-h LC50 (mmol/L) = -1.1651 (log Kow) + 2.4932

The LC50 is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 14 + 1; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) =
0.5337. To convert the LC50 from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the
compound.

GREEN ALGAE ChV

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The green algae chronic values (ChV) used to develop this SAR were measured and the octanol
water partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program, KOWWIN
(Version 1.67). The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log ChV (mmol/L) = -0.4426 (log Kow) - 1.1194

The ChV is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 1 + 1; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) =
N/A. To convert the ChV from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the compound.

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The fish 96-h LC50 values used to develop this SAR were measured and the octanol water partition
coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program, KOWWIN (Version 1.67). The SAR
equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log 96-h LC50 (mmol/L) = -0.4158 (log Kow) - 2.6628

The LC50 is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 10; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) = 0.6295.
To convert the LC50 from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the compound.

DAPHNID ChV

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The daphnid chronic values (ChV) used to develop this SAR were measured and the octanol water
partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program, KOWWIN (Version 1.67). The
SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log ChV (mmol/L) = -0.2232 (log Kow) – 4.034

The ChV is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 1 + 1; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) = N/A. To
convert the ChV from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the compound.

Fish (SW) ChV

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
No adequate data were available for the thiocyanates fish (SW) chronic value (ChV) SAR.
Predictions for this endpoint were estimated using the acute-to-chronic ratio, and were based on
the acute fish (SW) SAR for thiocyanates. The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log ChV (mmol/L) = -0.2144 (log Kow) – 3.0147

The ChV is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 0 + 2; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) =
N/A. To convert the ChV from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the compound.

Application:
This SAR may be used to estimate toxicity for thiols and mercaptans. Thiols with a carboxylic acid
substitution will be about 10 times less toxic than the toxicity value predicted using this SAR with a log
Kow and molecular weight for the free acid.

Limitations:
For thiols with log Kow values greater than 4.5, the toxicity prediction may only apply to rainbow trout and
other cold water fish species. While a 96-h LC50 value was measured for t-dodecane thiol (log Kow =
6.2), nonylthiol (log Kow = 4.9) showed no toxicity at saturation with fathead minnows. The recommended
species for testing thiols with log Kow values greater than 4.5 is rainbow trout using a flow-through
methods, measured concentrations, and treatment concentrations which do not exceed the aqueous
solubility limit of the thiol being tested.

If the compound is solid and the LC50 exceeds the water solubility by 10X, no effects at saturation are
predicted.

DAPHNID 48-h LC50

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The daphnid 48-h LC50 values used to develop this SAR were measured and the octanol water partition
coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program, KOWWIN (Version 1.67). The SAR
equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log 48-h LC50 (mmol/L) = -0.3983 (log Kow) - 1.5571

The LC50 is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 6 + 3; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) = 0.5378.
To convert the LC50 from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the compound.

GREEN ALGAE 96-h EC50 (Growth)

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The green algae 96-h EC50 values used to develop this SAR were measured and the octanol water
partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program, KOWWIN (Version 1.67). The
SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log 96-h EC50 (mmol/L) = -0.3631 (log Kow) - 1.7862

The EC50 is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 3; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) = 0.9976. To
convert the EC50 from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the compound.

The green algae ChV values used to develop this SAR were measured and the octanol water partition
coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program, KOWWIN (Version 1.67). The SAR
equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log ChV (mmol/L) = -0.2929 (log Kow) - 2.3167

The ChV is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 1 + 1; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) = N/A. To
convert the ChV from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the compound.

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The daphnid 48-h LC50 values used to develop this SAR were measured and the
octanol water partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer
program, KOWWIN (Version 1.67). The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity
is:

Log 48-h LC50 (mmol/L) = -0.0788 (log Kow) – 2.3861

The LC50 is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 3 + 1; and the Coefficient of

GREEN ALGAE ChV

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The green algae ChV values used to develop this SAR were measured and the
octanol water partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer
program, KOWWIN (Version 1.67). The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity
is:

Log ChV (mmol/L) = -0.3182 (log Kow) – 2.1142

The ChV is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 1 + 1; and the Coefficient of
Determination (R2) = N/A. To convert the ChV from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the
molecular weight of the compound.

FISH 96-h LC50 (Mortality)

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The fish 96-h LC50 values used to develop this SAR were measured and the octanol water
partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program, KOWWIN (Version
1.67). The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log 96-h LC50 (mmol/L) = -1.0333 (log Kow) + 2.3864

The LC50 is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 1 + 1; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) =
N/A. To convert the LC50 from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the compound.

GREEN ALGAE ChV

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The green algae chronic values (ChV) used to develop this SAR were measured and the octanol
water partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program, KOWWIN
(Version 1.67). The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log ChV (mmol/L) = -0.2558 (log Kow) - 2.6136

The ChV is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 3 + 1; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) =
0.9884. To convert the ChV from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the
compound.

GREEN ALGAE 96-h EC50 (Growth)

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The green algae 96-h EC50 values used to develop this SAR were measured and the octanol
water partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program, KOWWIN
(Version 1.67). Available data were considered supplemental (Klimisch Rating: 3)1 due to
insufficient measurement of test concentrations, unknown test substance composition,
and the use of only 2 replicates; however, better data were not available and toxicity was

GREEN ALGAE ChV

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The green algae ChV values used to develop this SAR were measured and the octanol water
partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program, KOWWIN (Version
1.67). Available data were considered supplemental (Klimisch Rating: 3)1 due to
insufficient measurement of test concentrations, unknown test substance composition,
and the use of only 2 replicates; however, better data were not available and toxicity was
observed. The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log ChV (mmol/L) = -0.2942 (log Kow) – 2.3065

The ChV is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 1 + 1; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) =
N/A. To convert the ChV from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the compound.

DAPHNID 48-h LC50 (Mortality)

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The daphnid 48-h LC50 values used to develop this SAR were measured and the octanol water
partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program, KOWWIN (Version
1.67). The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log 48-h LC50 (mmol/L) = -0.597 (log Kow) + 0.5945

The LC50 is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 10 + 3; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) =
0.339. To convert the LC50 from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the
compound.

Maximum Kow: 5.0
Maximum MW: 1000

Application:
This SAR may be used to estimate toxicity for aromatic triazines.

Limitations:
If the log Kow value is greater than 5.0, or if the compound is solid and the LC50 exceeds the
water solubility by 10X, no effects at saturation are predicted.

GREEN ALGAE 96-h EC50 (Growth)

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The green algae 96-h EC50 values used to develop this SAR were measured and the octanol
water partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program, KOWWIN
(Version 1.67). The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log 96-h EC50 (mmol/L) = -0.4449 (log Kow) – 2.1848

The EC50 is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 11 + 1; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) =
0.1397. To convert the EC50 from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the
compound.

DAPHNID ChV

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The daphnid chronic values (ChV) used to develop this SAR were measured and the octanol
water partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program, KOWWIN
(Version 1.67). The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log ChV (mmol/L) = -0.6241 (log Kow) - 0.7189

The ChV is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 3 + 1; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) =
0.731. To convert the ChV from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the compound.

MYSID (SW) 96-h LC50

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The mysid (SW) 96-h LC50 values used to develop this SAR were measured and the octanol
water partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program, KOWWIN
(Version 1.67). The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log 96-h LC50 (mmol/L) = -0.7089 (log Kow) + 0.1176

The LC50 is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 9 + 1; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) =
0.2639. To convert the LC50 from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the
compound.

Maximum Kow: 5.0
Maximum MW: 1000

FISH 96-h LC50 (Mortality)

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
Fish 96-h LC50 values used to develop this SAR were measured and the octanol water partition
coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program, KOWWIN (Version 1.67).
Based on observed effects for fish, this chemical class is not expressing excess toxicity
compared to neutral organics. The class-specific SAR equation is yielding lower toxicity values
than estimated from baseline toxicity (neutral organics), which may be related to testing
artifacts. Since most available data did not achieve an LC50 value at the highest dose tested, a
class-specific SAR equation could not be determined; values depicted below represent the
highest test concentrations:

This SAR may be used to estimate toxicity for triazole pyrimidine sulfonamides.

LIMITATIONS:
If the log Kow value is greater than 5.0, or if the compound is solid and the LC50 exceeds the
water solubility by 10X, no effects at saturation are expected.

DAPHNID 48-h LC50

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The daphnid 48-h LC50 values used to develop this SAR were measured and the octanol water
partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program, KOWWIN (Version
1.67). The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log 48-h LC50 (mmol/L) = -0.8395 (log Kow) + 0.8018

The LC50 is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 6 + 2; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) =
0.8852. To convert the LC50 from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the
compound.

GREEN ALGAE 96-h EC50

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The green algae 96-h EC50 values used to develop this SAR were measured, and the octanol
water partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program, KOWWIN
(Version 1.67). The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log 96-h EC50 (mmol/L) = -0.5073 (log Kow) – 3.5138

The EC50 is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 4; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) =
0.3019. To convert the EC50 from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the
compound.

Maximum Kow: 6.4
Maximum MW: 1000

LIMITATIONS:
If the log Kow value is greater than 6.4, or if the compound is solid and the EC50 exceeds the
water solubility by 10X, no effects at saturation are predicted.

FISH ChV

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
Fish chronic values (ChV) used to develop this SAR were measured and the octanol water
partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program, KOWWIN (Version
1.67). Based on observed effects for fish, this chemical class is not expressing excess toxicity
compared to neutral organics. The class-specific SAR equation is yielding lower toxicity values
than estimated from baseline toxicity (neutral organics), which may be related to testing
artifacts. Since most available data did not achieve a ChV value at the highest dose tested, a
class-specific SAR equation could not be determined; values depicted below represent the
highest test concentrations:

DAPHNID ChV

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The daphnid chronic values (ChV) used to develop this SAR were measured and the octanol water
partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program, KOWWIN (Version 1.67). Based
on observed effects for daphnids, this chemical class is not expressing excess toxicity compared to
neutral organics. The class-specific SAR equation is yielding lower toxicity values than estimated from
baseline toxicity (neutral organics), which may be related to testing artifacts. These chemicals may be
acting in a manner similar to neutral organics. Therefore, either the empirically based class-specific DChV
equation or the neutral organics DChV equation would be appropriate to estimate toxicity. The class-
specific SAR equation is:

Log ChV (mmol/L) = -0.8398 (log Kow) + 0.8979

The ChV is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 2 + 1; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) =
1. To convert the ChV from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the compound.

SAR                                              Triazole Pyrimidine Sulfonamides                    5/2011

GREEN ALGAE ChV

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The green algae chronic value ChV used to develop this SAR were measured, and the octanol
water partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program, KOWWIN
(Version 1.67). The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log ChV (mmol/L) = 0.0 (log Kow) – 4.6907

The ChV is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 4 + 1; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) =
0.0005. To convert the EC50 from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the
compound.

Maximum Kow: 8.0
Maximum MW: 1000

DAPHNID 48-h LC50

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The daphnid 48-h LC50 values used to develop this SAR were measured and the octanol water
partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program, KOWWIN (Version
1.67). The class-specific SAR equation is yielding toxicity values similar to baseline toxicity
(neutral organics), which may be related to testing artifacts. These chemicals may be acting in a
manner similar to neutral organics. Therefore, either the empirically based class-specific D48
equation or the neutral organics D48 equation would be appropriate to estimate toxicity. The
class-specific SAR equation is:

Log 48-h LC50 (mmol/L) = -0.4087 (log Kow) – 0.4539

The LC50 is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 9 + 8; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) =
0.5454. To convert the LC50 from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the
compound.

Maximum Kow: 5.0
Maximum MW: 1000

Application:
This SAR may be used to estimate toxicity for triazole.

Limitations:
If the log Kow value is greater than 5.0, or if the compound is solid and the LC50 exceeds the
water solubility by 10X, no effects at saturation are expected.

GREEN ALGAE 96-h EC50

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The green algae 96-h EC50 values used to develop this SAR were measured and the octanol
water partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program, KOWWIN
(Version 1.67). The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log 96-h EC50 (mmol/L) = -0.5449 (log Kow) – 0.3541

The EC50 is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 8 + 2; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) =
0.7702. To convert the EC50 from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the
compound.

Maximum Kow: 6.4
Maximum MW: 1000

FISH ChV

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The fish ChV values used to develop this SAR were measured and the octanol water partition
coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program, KOWWIN (Version 1.67). The
SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log ChV (mmol/L) = -0.6034 (log Kow) – 1.907

The ChV is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 6 + 2; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) =
0.7173. To convert the ChV from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the
compound.

DAPHNID ChV

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The daphnid ChV values used to develop this SAR were measured and the octanol
water partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program,
KOWWIN (Version 1.67). The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log ChV (mmol/L) = -0.6169 (log Kow) - 0.9518

The ChV is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 5 + 1; and the Coefficient of Determination
(R2) = 0.8865. To convert the ChV from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight
of the compound.

Maximum Kow: 8.0
Maximum MW: 1000

Mysid 96-h LC50 (Mortality)

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The invertebrate (SW) 96-h LC50 values used to develop this SAR were measured and the octanol water
partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program, KOWWIN (Version 1.67). The
SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log 96-h LC50 (mmol/L) = -0.8527 (log Kow) + 0.6284

The LC50 is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 3 + 2; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) = 0.9537.
To convert the LC50 from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the compound.

Mysid ChV

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The mysid chronic values (ChV) used to develop this SAR were measured and the octanol
water partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program, KOWWIN
(Version 1.67). The class-specific SAR equation is yielding toxicity values similar to baseline
toxicity (neutral organics), which may be related to testing artifacts. These chemicals may be
acting in a manner similar to neutral organics. Therefore, either the empirically based class-
specific mysid ChV equation or the neutral organics mysid ChV equation would be appropriate
to estimate toxicity. The class-specific SAR equation is:

Log ChV (mmol/L) = -1.4065 (log Kow) + 2.1892

The ChV is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 2 + 1; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) = 0.9731.
To convert the ChV from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the compound.

Log 96-h LC50 (mmol/L) = -0.1496 (log Kow) – 1.4138

The LC50 is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 5 + 6; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) =
0.071. To convert the LC50 from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the
compound.

DAPHNID ChV

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
No adequate data were available for the vinyl/allyl esters daphnid chronic value (ChV) SAR
endpoint. Predictions for this endpoint were estimated using the acute-to-chronic ratio, and were
based on the acute daphnid SAR for vinyl/allyl esters. The SAR equation used to estimate
toxicity is:

Log ChV (mmol/L) = -0.3151 (log Kow) - 3.2993

The ChV is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 0 + 2; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) =
N/A. To convert the ChV from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the compound.

GREEN ALGAE 96-h EC50

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The green algae 96-h EC50 values used to develop this SAR were measured and the octanol
water partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program, KOWWIN
(Version 1.67). The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log 96-h EC50 (mmol/L) = -0.6628 (log Kow) + 0.8122

The EC50 is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 1 + 1; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) =
N/A. To convert the EC50 from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the compound.

DAPHNID 48-h LC50 (Mortality)

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The daphnid 48-h LC50 values used to develop this SAR were measured and the octanol water partition
coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program, KOWWIN (Version 1.67). The SAR
equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log 48-h LC50 (mmol/L) = -0.336 (log Kow) - 0.5185

The LC50 is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 6 + 1; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) = 0.6316.
To convert the LC50 from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the compound.

GREEN ALGAE ChV

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The green algae chronic values (ChV) used to develop this SAR were measured and the octanol water
partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program, KOWWIN (Version 1.67). The
SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log ChV (mmol/L) = -0.3273 (log Kow) - 1.8156

The ChV is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 3 + 1; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) = 0.9825.
To convert the ChV from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the compound.

FISH ChV

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
No adequate data were available for the vinyl/allyl ethers fish chronic value (ChV) SAR endpoint.
Predictions for this endpoint were estimated using the acute-to-chronic ratio, and were based on
the acute fish SAR for vinyl/allyl ethers. The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log ChV (mmol/L) = -0.4868 (log Kow) - 2.3054

The ChV is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 0 + 2; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) =
N/A. To convert the ChV from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the compound.

Application:
This SAR may be used to estimate toxicity for vinyl/allyl halides.

Limitations:
If the log Kow value is greater than 5.0, or if the compound is solid and the LC50 exceeds the water
solubility by 10X, no effects at saturation are predicted.

DAPHNID 48-h LC50 (Mortality)

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The daphnid 48-h LC50 values used to develop this SAR were measured and the octanol water partition
coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program, KOWWIN (Version 1.67). The SAR
equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log 48-h LC50 (mmol/L) = -0.8797 (log Kow) + 0.9554

The LC50 is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N =11 + 2; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) = 0.5263.
To convert the LC50 from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the compound.

Application:
This SAR may be used to estimate toxicity for vinyl/allyl halides.

Limitations:
If the log Kow value is greater than 5.0, or if the compound is solid and the LC50 exceeds the water
solubility by 10X, no effects at saturation are predicted.

GREEN ALGAE 96-h EC50

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The green algae 96-h EC50 values used to develop this SAR were measured and the octanol water
partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program, KOWWIN (Version 1.67). Based
on observed effects for green algae, this chemical class is not expressing excess toxicity compared to
neutral organics. The class-specific SAR equation is yielding similar toxicity values than estimated from
baseline toxicity (neutral organics), which may be related to testing artifacts. These chemicals may be
acting in a manner similar to neutral organics. Therefore, either the empirically based class-specific
GA96 equation or the neutral organics GA96 equation would be appropriate to estimate toxicity. The
class-specific SAR equation is:

Log 96-h EC50 (mmol/L) = -0.7563 (log Kow) + 0.8702

The EC50 is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 1 + 1; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) = N/A. To
convert the EC50 from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the compound.

FISH ChV

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The fish chronic values (ChV) used to develop this SAR were measured and the octanol water partition
coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program, KOWWIN (Version 1.67). The SAR
equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log ChV (mmol/L) = -1.2035 (log Kow) + 1.3275

The ChV is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 7; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) = 0.8681. To
convert the ChV from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the compound.

DAPHNID ChV

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The daphnid chronic values (ChV ) used to develop this SAR were measured and the octanol water
partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program, KOWWIN (Version 1.67). The
SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log ChV (mmol/L) = -0.3274 (log Kow) – 2.3594

The LC50 is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 2; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) = N/A. To
convert the LC50 from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the compound.

GREEN ALGAE ChV

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
No adequate data were available for the vinyl/allyl halides SAR green algae chronic value (ChV)
endpoint. Predictions for this endpoint were estimated using the acute-to-chronic ratio, and were based
on the acute green algae SAR for vinyl/allyl halides. Based on observed effects for green algae, this
chemical class is not expressing excess toxicity compared to neutral organics. The class-specific SAR
equation is yielding similar toxicity values than estimated from baseline toxicity (neutral organics), which
may be related to testing artifacts. These chemicals may be acting in a manner similar to neutral
organics. Therefore, either the empirically based class-specific GAChV equation or the neutral organics
GAChV equation would be appropriate to estimate toxicity. The class-specific SAR equation is:

Log ChV (mmol/L) = -0.5594 (log Kow) - 0.1846

The ChV is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 0 + 2; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) = N/A. To
convert the ChV from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the compound.

FISH (SW) 96-h LC50 (Mortality)

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The fish (sw) 96-h LC50 values used to develop this SAR were measured and the octanol water partition
coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program, KOWWIN (Version 1.67). The SAR
equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log 96-h LC50 (mmol/L) = -0.9932 (log Kow) + 1.1201

The LC50 is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 8 + 3; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) = 0.8405.
To convert the LC50 from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the compound.

FISH 96-h LC50 (Mortality)

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The fish 96-h LC50 values used to develop this SAR were measured and the octanol water
partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program, KOWWIN (Version
1.67). Based on observed effects for fish, this chemical class is not expressing excess toxicity
compared to neutral organics. The class-specific SAR equation is yielding lower toxicity values
than estimated from baseline toxicity (neutral organics), which may be related to testing artifacts.
These chemicals may be acting in a manner similar to neutral organics. Therefore, either the
empirically based class-specific F96 equation or the neutral organics F96 equation would be
appropriate to estimate toxicity. The class-specific SAR equation is:

Log 96-h LC50 (mmol/L) = -0.7628(log Kow) + 1.533

The LC50 is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 7 + 1; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) =
0.711. To convert the LC50 from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the
compound.

DAPHNID 48-h LC50 (Mortality)

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The daphnid 48-h LC50 values used to develop this SAR were measured and the octanol water

Log 48-h LC50 (mmol/L) = -0.898 (log Kow) + 1.6263

The LC50 is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 3 + 1; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) =

The ChV is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 3 + 1; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) =

DAPHNID ChV

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
No adequate data were available for the vinyl/allyl ketones daphnid chronic value (ChV) SAR.
Predictions for this endpoint were estimated using the acute-to-chronic ratio, and were based on
the acute daphnid SAR for vinyl/allyl ketones. Based on observed effects for daphnids, this
chemical class is not expressing excess toxicity compared to neutral organics. The class-specific
SAR equation is yielding lower toxicity values than estimated from baseline toxicity (neutral
organics), which may be related to testing artifacts. These chemicals may be acting in a manner
similar to neutral organics. Therefore, either the empirically based class-specific DChV equation
or the neutral organics DChV equation would be appropriate to estimate toxicity. The class-
specific SAR equation is:

Log ChV (mmol/L) = -0.8058 (log Kow) + 0.6263

The ChV is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 0 + 2; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) =
N/A. To convert the ChV from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the compound.

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
No adequate data were available for the vinyl/allyl ketones green algae chronic value (ChV) SAR.
Predictions for this endpoint were estimated using the acute-to-chronic ratio, and were based on

MYSID (SW) 96-h LC50

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The mysid (sw) 96-h LC50 values used to develop this SAR were measured and the octanol

Therefore, either the empirically based class-specific M96(SW) equation or the neutral organics

Log 48-h LC50 (mmol/L) = -1.118 (log Kow) + 1.9099

The LC50 is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 1 + 2; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) =

FISH (SW) ChV

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The fish chronic values (ChV) used to develop this SAR were measured and the octanol water
partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program, KOWWIN (Version
1.67). Based on observed effects for saltwater fish, this chemical class is not expressing excess
toxicity compared to neutral organics. The class-specific SAR equation is yielding lower toxicity
values than estimated from baseline toxicity (neutral organics), which may be related to testing
artifacts. These chemicals may be acting in a manner similar to neutral organics. Therefore,
either the empirically based class-specific FChV(SW) equation or the neutral organics FChV(SW)
equation would be appropriate to estimate toxicity. The class-specific SAR equation is:

Log ChV (mmol/L) = -0.8577 (log Kow) + 2.1315

The ChV is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 1 + 1; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) =
N/A. To convert the ChV from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the compound.

MYSID (SW) ChV

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
No adequate data were available for the vinyl/allyl ketones mysid (SW) chronic value (ChV) SAR.
Predictions for this endpoint were estimated using the acute-to-chronic ratio, and were based on
the acute mysid (SW) SAR for vinyl/allyl ketones. Based on observed effects for mysid shrimp,
this chemical class is not expressing excess toxicity compared to neutral organics. The class-
specific SAR equation is yielding similar toxicity values than estimated from baseline toxicity
(neutral organics), which may be related to testing artifacts. These chemicals may be acting in a
manner similar to neutral organics. Therefore, either the empirically based class-specific
MChV(SW) equation or the neutral organics MChV(SW) equation would be appropriate to
estimate toxicity. The class-specific SAR equation is:

Log ChV (mmol/L) = -1.3135 (log Kow) + 1.4183

The ChV is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 0 + 2; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) =
N/A. To convert the ChV from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the compound.

GREEN ALGAE 96-h EC50

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The green algae 96-h EC50 values used to develop this SAR were measured and the octanol water
partition coefficients (Kow) were calculated using the computer program, KOWWIN (Version 1.67). The
SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log 96-h EC50 (mmol/L) = -0.4271 (log Kow) - 1.2366

The EC50 is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 1 + 1; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) = N/A. To
convert the EC50 from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the compound.

FISH 96-h LC50 (Mortality)

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
The fish 96-h LC50 value for n-vinylcarbazole used to develop the SAR for vinyl/allyl
pyrazoles/pyrroles was measured and the octanol water partition coefficient (Kow) was calculated
using the computer program, KOWWIN (Version 1.67). When compared to the related fish 96-h
LC50 SAR for the pyrazole-pyrroles class, analysis of the data for this single compound indicates
that the presence of the vinyl/allyl functional group associated with the aromatic amine may be
contributing to much higher toxicity. Additional data for analogous compounds with the vinyl/allyl
component attached to the aromatic amine could not be located and, thus, there is uncertainty
regarding this sub-classification of the pyrazoles/pyrroles class. Based on the data for this single
compound with a log Kow value of 4.8, we do not expect this chemical to converge towards
baseline toxicity at higher log Kow values. Therefore the SAR equation is assumed to parallel the
neutral organics slope. The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log 96-h LC50 (mmol/L) = -0.8981 (log Kow) – 1.0085

The LC50 is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 1 + 1; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) =
N/A. To convert the LC50 from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the compound.

Application:
This SAR may be used to estimate toxicity for vinyl/allyl sulfones.

Limitations:
If the log Kow value is greater than 8.0, or if the compound is solid and the ChV exceeds the water
solubility by 10X, no effects at saturation are predicted.

DAPHNID ChV

ESTIMATED TOXICITY:
No adequate data were available for the vinyl/allyl sulfones daphnid chronic value (ChV) SAR endpoint.
Predictions for this endpoint were estimated using the acute-to-chronic ratio, and were based on the
acute daphnid SAR for vinyl/allyl sulfones. The SAR equation used to estimate toxicity is:

Log ChV (mmol/L) = -0.668 (log Kow) - 0.4762

The ChV is in millimoles per liter (mM/L); N = 0 + 2; and the Coefficient of Determination (R2) = N/A. To
convert the ChV from mM/L to mg/L, multiply by the molecular weight of the compound.

Maximum Kow: 8.0
Maximum MW: 1000
